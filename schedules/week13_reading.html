  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Tell the children of Israel to take for Me a heave offering. From every man whose heart makes him willing you shall take My heave offering.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And this is the heave offering which you shall take from them: gold and silver and bronze,<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And blue and purple and scarlet <i>strands,</i> and fine linen, and goats’ <i>hair,</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And rams’ skins dyed red, and porpoise skins, and acacia wood,<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> Oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense,<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Onyx stones and stones to be set for the ephod and for the breastplate.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And let them make a sanctuary for Me that I may dwell in their midst;<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> According to all that I show you, the pattern of the tabernacle and the pattern of all its furnishings, even so shall you make <i>it.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And they shall make an ark of acacia wood: two and a half cubits shall be its length; and one and a half cubits, its width; and one and a half cubits, its height.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And you shall overlay it with pure gold; inside and outside you shall overlay it; and you shall make a rim of gold upon it all around.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And you shall cast four rings of gold for it, and put <i>them</i> on its four feet; and two rings shall be on one side of it, and two rings on the other side of it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> And you shall make poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> And you shall put the poles into the rings on the sides of the Ark to carry the Ark with them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> The poles shall be in the rings of the Ark; they shall not be taken from it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And you shall put into the Ark the Testimony which I will give you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> And you shall make an expiation cover of pure gold: two and a half cubits shall be its length, and one and a half cubits, its width.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> And you shall make two cherubim of gold; of beaten work you shall make them, at the two ends of the expiation cover.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> And make one cherub at one end and one cherub at the other end; of <i>one piece with</i> the expiation cover you shall make the cherubim on its two ends.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> And the cherubim shall spread out their wings above <i>the cover,</i> covering the expiation cover with their wings, with their faces toward one another; the faces of the cherubim shall be toward the expiation cover.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And you shall put the expiation cover upon the Ark above <i>it,</i> and into the Ark you shall put the Testimony that I will give you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> And there I will meet with you, and I will speak with you from above the expiation cover, from between the two cherubim which are upon the Ark of the Testimony, of everything which I will give you in commandment to the children of Israel.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> And you shall make a table of acacia wood: two cubits shall be its length, and a cubit its width, and one and a half cubits its height.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> And you shall overlay it with pure gold and make a rim of gold around it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> And you shall make a frame of a handbreadth around it; and you shall make a rim of gold for its frame around <i>it.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> And you shall make for it four rings of gold and put the rings on the four corners that are on its four feet.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> The rings shall be close to the frame as holders for the poles to carry the table.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> And you shall make the poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold, and the table shall be carried with them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> And you shall make its plates and its cups and its pitchers and its bowls with which to pour out <i>drink offerings;</i> of pure gold you shall make them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> And you shall set the bread of the Presence upon the table before Me always.<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> And you shall make a lampstand of pure gold. The lampstand <i>with</i> its base and its shaft shall be made of beaten work; its cups, its calyxes, and its blossom buds shall be of <i>one piece with</i> it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> And there shall be six branches going out of its sides; three branches of the lampstand out of one of its sides, and three branches of the lampstand out of its other side;<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> Three cups made like almond <i>blossoms</i> in one branch, a calyx and a blossom bud; and three cups made like almond <i>blossoms</i> in the other branch, a calyx and a blossom bud — so for the six branches going out of the lampstand.<br><br>
     <sup><b>34</b></sup> And <i>there shall be</i> on the lampstand four cups made like almond <i>blossoms,</i> its calyxes and its blossom buds;<br><br>
     <sup><b>35</b></sup> And a calyx under two branches of <i>one piece with</i> it, and a calyx under two branches of <i>one piece with</i> it, and a calyx under two branches of <i>one piece with</i> it, for the six branches going out of the lampstand.<br><br>
     <sup><b>36</b></sup> Their calyxes and their branches shall be of <i>one piece with</i> it; all of it one beaten work of pure gold.<br><br>
     <sup><b>37</b></sup> And you shall make its lamps, seven; and set up its lamps to give light to the area in front of it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>38</b></sup> And its tongs and its firepans shall be of pure gold.<br><br>
     <sup><b>39</b></sup> It shall be made of a talent of pure gold, with all these utensils.<br><br>
     <sup><b>40</b></sup> And see that you make <i>them</i> according to their pattern, which was shown to you in the mountain.<br><br>

  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Now the tabernacle you shall make with ten curtains of fine twined linen and blue and purple and scarlet <i>strands;</i> you shall make them with cherubim, the work of a skillful workman.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> The length of each curtain shall be twenty-eight cubits, and the width of each curtain, four cubits; all the curtains shall have the same measurement.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> Five curtains shall be joined to one another; and <i>the other</i> five curtains shall be joined to one another.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And you shall make loops of blue <i>strands</i> on the edge of the one curtain at the end in the set; and likewise you shall make <i>them</i> in the edge of the outermost curtain in the second set.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> You shall make fifty loops on the one curtain, and you shall make fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that is in the second set; the loops shall be opposite one another.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And you shall make fifty clasps of gold, and join the curtains to one another with the clasps, so that the tabernacle may become one.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And you shall make curtains of goats’ <i>hair</i> for a tent over the tabernacle; eleven curtains you shall make in all.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> The length of each curtain shall be thirty cubits, and the width of each curtain, four cubits; the eleven curtains shall have the same measurement.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> And you shall join five of the curtains by themselves and six of the curtains by themselves, and you shall double the sixth curtain over at the front of the tent.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And you shall make fifty loops on the edge of the one curtain that is outermost in the set, and fifty loops upon the edge of the curtain which is <i>outermost in</i> the second set.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And you shall make fifty clasps of bronze and put the clasps into the loops and join the tent together, so that it may become one.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And the overlapping part that is left over of the curtains of the tent, the half curtain that is left over, shall hang over the back of the tabernacle.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> And the cubit on the one side and the cubit on the other side, of what is left over in the length of the curtains of the tent, shall hang over the sides of the tabernacle, on this side and on that side, to cover it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> And you shall make a covering for the tent, of rams’ skins dyed red, and a covering of porpoise skins above <i>it.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And you shall make the boards for the tabernacle of acacia wood, standing up.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> Ten cubits shall be the length of a board, and one and a half cubits, the width of each board.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> Each board shall have two tenons, joined to one another; thus you shall do for all the boards of the tabernacle.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> And you shall make the boards for the tabernacle, twenty boards for the south side southward.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> And you shall make forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards, two sockets under one board for its two tenons and two sockets under the next board for its two tenons.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> And for the second side of the tabernacle, on the north side, twenty boards;<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And their forty sockets of silver, two sockets under one board and two sockets under the next board.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> And for the rear of the tabernacle westward you shall make six boards.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> And two boards you shall make for the corners of the tabernacle in the rear.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> And they shall be double below, and at its top they shall be completely joined to a single ring; thus it shall be for both of them; they shall be for the two corners.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> And there shall be eight boards with their sockets of silver, sixteen sockets; two sockets under one board and two sockets under the next board.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> And you shall make bars of acacia wood, five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle,<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the side of the tabernacle at the rear westward.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> And the middle bar shall pass through in the center of the boards from end to end.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> And you shall overlay the boards with gold, and make their rings of gold as holders for the bars; and you shall overlay the bars with gold.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> And you shall set up the tabernacle according to its plan, which you were shown in the mountain.<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> And you shall make a veil of blue and purple and scarlet <i>strands</i> and fine twined linen; it shall be made with cherubim, the work of a skillful workman.<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> And you shall hang it upon four pillars of acacia overlaid with gold; their hooks shall be of gold, <i>and they shall stand</i> on four sockets of silver.<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> And you shall hang up the veil under the clasps and bring in the Ark of the Testimony there within the veil; and the veil shall make a separation for you between the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies.<br><br>
     <sup><b>34</b></sup> And you shall put the expiation cover upon the Ark of the Testimony in the Holy of Holies.<br><br>
     <sup><b>35</b></sup> And you shall set the table outside the veil, and the lampstand opposite the table on the side of the tabernacle toward the south; and the table you shall put on the north side.<br><br>
     <sup><b>36</b></sup> And you shall make a screen for the entrance of the tent, of blue and purple and scarlet <i>strands</i> and fine twined linen, the work of an embroiderer.<br><br>
     <sup><b>37</b></sup> And for the screen you shall make five pillars of acacia and overlay them with gold; their hooks shall be of gold, and you shall cast five sockets of bronze for them.<br><br>
