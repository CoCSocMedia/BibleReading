  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And this is what you shall do to them to sanctify them to serve Me as priests: take one bull of the herd and two rams without blemish,<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And unleavened bread and unleavened cakes mingled with oil and unleavened wafers anointed with oil — you shall make them of fine wheat flour.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And you shall put them into one basket and present them in the basket with the bull and the two rams.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And you shall bring Aaron and his sons near to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, and wash them with water.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And you shall take the garments and clothe Aaron with the tunic and the robe of the ephod and the ephod and the breastplate, and gird him with the skillfully woven band of the ephod;<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And you shall place the turban on his head and put the holy crown on the turban.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Then you shall take the anointing oil and pour <i>it</i> on his head and anoint him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And you shall bring his sons near and put tunics on them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> And you shall gird them with girding sashes, Aaron and his sons, and bind high hats on them; and they shall have the priesthood by a perpetual statute. So you shall consecrate Aaron and his sons.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And you shall present the bull before the Tent of Meeting, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the bull.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And you shall slaughter the bull before Jehovah at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And you shall take some of the blood of the bull and put <i>some of it</i> on the horns of the altar with your finger, and all <i>the rest of</i> the blood you shall pour out at the base of the altar.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> And you shall take all the fat that covers the inward parts and the appendage on the liver and the two kidneys and the fat that is on them, and burn <i>them</i> on the altar.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> But the flesh of the bull and its skin and its dung you shall burn with fire outside the camp; it is a sin offering.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And you shall also take the one ram, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the ram.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And you shall slaughter the ram, and you shall take its blood and sprinkle <i>it</i> on and around the altar.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> Then you shall cut the ram into its pieces and wash its inward parts and its legs, and put <i>them</i> with its pieces and its head.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> And you shall burn the whole ram on the altar; it is a burnt offering to Jehovah; it is a satisfying fragrance, an offering by fire to Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> And you shall take the other ram, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the ram.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> Then you shall slaughter the ram and take some of its blood and put <i>it</i> on the lobe of Aaron’s <i>right</i> ear and on the lobe of the right ear of his sons and on the thumb of their right hand and on the big toe of their right foot, and sprinkle <i>the rest of</i> the blood on and around the altar.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And you shall take some of the blood that is on the altar and some of the anointing oil, and sprinkle <i>it</i> on Aaron and on his garments, and on his sons and on his sons’ garments with him; and he and his garments shall be sanctified, as well as his sons and his sons’ garments with him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> You shall also take the fat from the ram, that is, the fat tail and the fat that covers the inward parts, and the appendage of the liver and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them and the right thigh (for it is a ram of consecration),<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> And one loaf of bread and one cake of oiled bread and one wafer out of the basket of unleavened bread that is before Jehovah;<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> And you shall put all <i>these</i> in the palms of Aaron and in the palms of his sons, and wave them as a wave offering before Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> And you shall take them from their hands and burn <i>them</i> on the altar upon the burnt offering for a satisfying fragrance before Jehovah; it is an offering by fire to Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> And you shall take the breast of the ram of Aaron’s consecration and wave it as a wave offering before Jehovah; and it shall be your portion.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> And you shall sanctify the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the heave offering which was waved and which was heaved up from the ram of consecration, from that which is for Aaron and from that which is for his sons.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> And it shall become a perpetual statute for Aaron and his sons <i>to be observed</i> by the children of Israel, for it is a heave offering; and it shall be a heave offering from the children of Israel from the sacrifices of their peace offerings, their heave offering to Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> (And the holy garments of Aaron shall belong to his sons after him, <i>for them</i> to be anointed in them and to be consecrated in them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> One of his sons, who is the priest in his place, shall put them on for seven days when he comes into the Tent of Meeting to minister in the sanctuary.)<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> And you shall take the ram of consecration and boil its flesh in a holy place.<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram and the bread that is in the basket at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> So they shall eat those things by which expiation was made, to consecrate them <i>and</i> to sanctify them; but a stranger shall not eat <i>them,</i> because they are holy.<br><br>
     <sup><b>34</b></sup> And if any of the flesh <i>of the ram</i> of consecration or any of the bread remains until the morning, then you shall burn the remainder with fire; it shall not be eaten, because it is holy.<br><br>
     <sup><b>35</b></sup> And thus you shall do to Aaron and to his sons according to all that I have commanded you; you shall consecrate them seven days.<br><br>
     <sup><b>36</b></sup> And each day you shall offer a bull as a sin offering for expiation, and you shall cleanse the altar when you make expiation for it; and you shall anoint it to sanctify it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>37</b></sup> Seven days you shall make expiation for the altar and sanctify it, and the altar shall become most holy; whatever touches the altar shall be holy.<br><br>
     <sup><b>38</b></sup> Now this is what you shall offer on the altar: two lambs a year old, each day continually.<br><br>
     <sup><b>39</b></sup> The one lamb you shall offer in the morning, and the other lamb you shall offer at twilight.<br><br>
     <sup><b>40</b></sup> And with the one lamb a tenth <i>of an ephah</i> of fine flour mingled with a fourth of a hin of beaten oil, and a fourth of a hin of wine for a drink offering.<br><br>
     <sup><b>41</b></sup> And the other lamb you shall offer at twilight; you shall offer it with the meal offering and its drink offering as in the morning, for a satisfying fragrance, an offering by fire to Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>42</b></sup> It shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting before Jehovah, where I will meet with you to speak to you there.<br><br>
     <sup><b>43</b></sup> And there I will meet with the children of Israel; and it shall be sanctified by My glory.<br><br>
     <sup><b>44</b></sup> And I will sanctify the Tent of Meeting and the altar. Aaron also and his sons I will sanctify to serve Me as priests.<br><br>
     <sup><b>45</b></sup> And I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel, and I will be their God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>46</b></sup> And they shall know that I am Jehovah their God, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, that I might dwell in the midst of them; I am Jehovah their God.<br><br>

  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And you shall make an altar on which to burn incense; you shall make it of acacia wood.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Its length shall be a cubit, and its width, a cubit; it shall be square, and two cubits its height; its horns shall be of <i>one piece with</i> it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And you shall overlay it with pure gold, its top and its sides around <i>it</i> and its horns; and you shall make a rim of gold around <i>it.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And you shall make for it two rings of gold under its rim; on its two sides, on its opposite sides, you shall make <i>them;</i> and they shall be as holders for poles with which to carry it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And you shall make the poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And you shall put it before the veil that is over the Ark of the Testimony, before the expiation cover that is over the Testimony, where I will meet with you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And Aaron shall burn on it fragrant incense; every morning when he dresses the lamps he shall burn it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And when Aaron sets up the lamps at twilight, he shall burn it, a perpetual incense before Jehovah throughout your generations.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> You shall not offer any strange incense on it, or a burnt offering or a meal offering; and you shall not pour a drink offering on it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And Aaron shall make expiation on its horns once a year; with the blood of the sin offering of expiation once a year he shall make expiation for it throughout your generations. It is most holy to Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> When you take the sum of the children of Israel, according to their numbering, every man shall give a ransom for himself to Jehovah when you number them, that there may be no plague among them when you number them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> This they shall give, each one who was enrolled among their numbering, half a shekel according to the shekel of the sanctuary (the shekel is twenty gerahs), half a shekel as a heave offering to Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> Each one who was enrolled among their numbering, from twenty years old and over, shall give the heave offering of Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> The rich shall not give more and the poor shall not give less than the half shekel when you give the heave offering of Jehovah to make expiation for your souls.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And you shall take the expiation silver from the children of Israel and shall give it for the service of the Tent of Meeting, that it may be a memorial for the children of Israel before Jehovah to make expiation for your souls.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> You shall also make a laver of bronze, with its base of bronze, for washing. And you shall put it between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and you shall put water in it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> And Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet <i>with water</i> from it;<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> When they go into the Tent of Meeting, they shall wash with water, that they may not die; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn an offering by fire to Jehovah,<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> They shall wash their hands and their feet, that they may not die. And it shall be a perpetual statute to them, for him and for his seed throughout their generations.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> Moreover Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> You also take the finest spices: of flowing myrrh five hundred <i>shekels,</i> and of fragrant cinnamon half as much, two hundred fifty <i>shekels,</i> and of fragrant calamus two hundred fifty <i>shekels,</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> And of cassia five hundred <i>shekels,</i> according to the shekel of the sanctuary, and a hin of olive oil.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> And you shall make it a holy anointing oil, a fragrant ointment compounded according to the work of a compounder; it shall be a holy anointing oil.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> And with it you shall anoint the Tent of Meeting and the Ark of the Testimony,<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> And the table and all its utensils, and the lampstand and its utensils, and the altar of incense,<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> And the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the laver and its base.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> Thus you shall sanctify them that they may be most holy; whatever touches them shall be holy.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> And you shall anoint Aaron and his sons and sanctify them that they may serve Me as priests.<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> And you shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, This shall be a holy anointing oil to Me throughout your generations.<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> Upon the flesh of man it shall not be poured, nor shall you make <i>any</i> like it, according to its composition; it is holy, <i>and</i> it shall be holy to you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> Whoever compounds <i>any</i> like it or whoever puts any of it upon a stranger, he shall be cut off from his people.<br><br>
     <sup><b>34</b></sup> And Jehovah said to Moses, Take fragrant spices — stacte and onycha and galbanum — fragrant spices with pure frankincense; there shall be an equal part of each;<br><br>
     <sup><b>35</b></sup> And you shall make of it incense, a fragrant compound according to the work of a compounder, seasoned with salt, pure <i>and</i> holy.<br><br>
     <sup><b>36</b></sup> And you shall beat some of it very fine, and put some of it before the Testimony in the Tent of Meeting, where I will meet with you; it shall be to you most holy.<br><br>
     <sup><b>37</b></sup> And the incense which you shall make, you shall not make for yourselves according to its composition; it shall be holy to you for Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>38</b></sup> Whoever shall make <i>any</i> like it, to smell it, shall be cut off from his people.<br><br>
