  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And afterward Moses and Aaron came and said to Pharaoh, Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, Let My people go that they may hold a feast to Me in the wilderness.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> But Pharaoh said, Who is Jehovah that I should listen to His voice to let Israel go? I do not know Jehovah, and I also will not let Israel go.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And they said, The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Let us go a three days’ journey into the wilderness that we may sacrifice to Jehovah our God; otherwise He will fall upon us with pestilence or sword.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Then the king of Egypt said to them, Moses and Aaron, why are you trying to release the people from their work? Get back to your burdens.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And Pharaoh said, Look, the people of the land are now many, yet you want them to cease from their burdens.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And the same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and their officers, saying,<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> You shall no longer give the people straw to make bricks as previously; let them go and gather straw for themselves.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And the quota of the bricks which they made previously, you shall <i>still</i> place upon them; you shall not diminish any of it, for they are idle; therefore they cry out, saying, Let us go <i>and</i> sacrifice to our God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> Let the work be laid <i>more</i> heavily upon such men, so that they do it and not pay attention to false words.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And the taskmasters of the people and their officers went out and spoke to the people, saying, Thus says Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> You go <i>and</i> get your own straw wherever you can find <i>it,</i> for none of your work will be reduced.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> So the people scattered throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> And the taskmasters pressed <i>them</i> saying, Finish your work, the <i>same</i> daily assignment as when there was straw.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> And the officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten <i>and</i> told, Why have you not finished, both yesterday and today, the amount of bricks required of you previously?<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried out to Pharaoh, saying, Why do you treat your servants this way?<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> No straw is given to your servants, and they say to us, Make bricks. And now your servants are being beaten, but it is the fault of your own people.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> But he said, Idle is what you are, idle; therefore you say, Let us go <i>and</i> sacrifice to Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> So go now <i>and</i> work; and no straw shall be given you, but you shall deliver the quota of bricks.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> And the officers of the children of Israel saw that they were in trouble, <i>when</i> it was said, You shall not diminish any of the daily assignment of your bricks.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> And they came upon Moses and Aaron, who were standing there to meet them when they came forth from Pharaoh.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And they said to them, Jehovah look upon you and judge, because you have made us odious in the sight of Pharaoh and in the sight of his servants so as to put a sword in their hand to kill us.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> Then Moses went back to Jehovah and said, Lord, why have You mistreated this people? Why is it that You have sent me?<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> Ever since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Your name, he has mistreated this people, and You have not delivered Your people at all.<br><br>

  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And Jehovah said to Moses, Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh; for because of a mighty hand he will let them go, and because of a mighty hand he will drive them out of his land.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And God spoke to Moses and said to him, I am Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as the All-sufficient God; but by My name Jehovah I did not make Myself known to them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And I also established My covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their sojournings, in which they sojourned.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians have enslaved; and I have remembered My covenant.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> Therefore say to the children of Israel, I am Jehovah, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will deliver you from their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great acts of judgment.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And I will take you to Myself as <i>My</i> people, and I will be your God; and you shall know that I am Jehovah your God, the One who brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And I will bring you to the land which I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it to you as a possession. I am Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> And Moses spoke this to the children of Israel, but they did not listen to Moses on account of anguish of spirit and harsh bondage.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> Go, speak to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And Moses spoke before Jehovah, saying, The children of Israel do not now listen to me. How then will Pharaoh listen to me, since I am of uncircumcised lips?<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> And Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron and gave them a charge for the children of Israel and for Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> These are the heads of their fathers’ houses. The sons of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel: Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi; these are the families of Reuben.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel and Jamin and Ohad and Jachin and Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman; these are the families of Simeon.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations: Gershon and Kohath and Merari; and the years of Levi’s life were one hundred thirty-seven years.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> The sons of Gershon: Libni and Shimei, according to their families.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> And the sons of Kohath: Amram and Izhar and Hebron and Uzziel; and the years of Kohath’s life were one hundred thirty-three years.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> And the sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their generations.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> And Amram took Jochebed his father’s sister for himself as wife, and she bore him Aaron and Moses; and the years of Amram’s life were one hundred thirty-seven years.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And the sons of Izhar: Korah and Nepheg and Zichri.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> And the sons of Uzziel: Mishael and Elzaphan and Sithri.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> And Aaron took Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab, the sister of Nahshon, for himself as wife; and she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> And the sons of Korah: Assir and Elkanah and Abiasaph; these are the families of the Korahites.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> And Eleazar, Aaron’s son, took for himself one of the daughters of Putiel as wife, and she bore him Phinehas. These are the heads of the fathers’ <i>houses</i> of the Levites according to their families.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> It was <i>this same</i> Aaron and Moses to whom Jehovah said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> It was they who spoke to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt; it is <i>the same</i> Moses and Aaron.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> And on the day when Jehovah spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt,<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying, I am Jehovah; speak to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, all that I speak to you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> But Moses said before Jehovah, Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips. How then will Pharaoh listen to me?<br><br>
