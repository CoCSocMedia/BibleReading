  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And Bezalel made the Ark of acacia wood: two and a half cubits was its length; and one and a half cubits, its width; and one and a half cubits, its height.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And he overlaid it with pure gold inside and outside, and made a rim of gold around it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And he cast four rings of gold for it, on its four feet; and two rings were on the one side of it, and two rings on the other side of it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And he made poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And he put the poles into the rings on the sides of the Ark to carry the Ark.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And he made an expiation cover of pure gold: two and a half cubits was its length, and one and a half cubits, its width.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And he made two cherubim of gold; of beaten work he made them, at the two ends of the expiation cover,<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> One cherub at the one end and one cherub at the other end; of <i>one piece with</i> the expiation cover he made the cherubim at its two ends.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> And the cherubim spread out their wings above <i>the cover,</i> covering the expiation cover with their wings, with their faces toward one another; the faces of the cherubim were toward the expiation cover.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And he made the table of acacia wood: two cubits was its length, and a cubit its width, and one and a half cubits its height.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And he overlaid it with pure gold and made a rim of gold around it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And he made a frame of a handbreadth around it, and he made a rim of gold for its frame around <i>it.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> And he cast for it four rings of gold and put the rings on the four corners that were on its four feet.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> The rings were close to the frame <i>as</i> holders for the poles to carry the table.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And he made the poles of acacia wood to carry the table and overlaid them with gold.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And he made the utensils which were <i>to be</i> upon the table: its plates and its cups and its bowls and its pitchers with which to pour out <i>drink offerings,</i> of pure gold.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> And he made the lampstand of pure gold. He made the lampstand <i>with</i> its base and its shaft of beaten work; its cups, its calyxes, and its blossom buds were of one piece with it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> And there were six branches going out of its sides; three branches of the lampstand out of one of its sides, and three branches of the lampstand out of its other side;<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> Three cups made like almond <i>blossoms</i> in one branch, a calyx and a blossom bud; and three cups made like almond <i>blossoms</i> in the other branch, a calyx and a blossom bud â€” so for the six branches going out of the lampstand.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> And on the lampstand were four cups made like almond <i>blossoms,</i> its calyxes and its blossom buds;<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And a calyx under two branches of <i>one piece with</i> it, and a calyx under two branches of <i>one piece with</i> it, and a calyx under two branches of <i>one piece with</i> it, for the six branches going out of it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> Their calyxes and their branches were of <i>one piece with</i> it; all of it was one beaten work of pure gold.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> And he made its seven lamps and its tongs and its firepans, of pure gold.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> He made it of a talent of pure gold, and all its utensils.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> And he made the altar of incense of acacia wood; a cubit was its length, and a cubit, its width, square; and two cubits, its height; its horns were of <i>one piece with</i> it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> And he overlaid it with pure gold, its top and its sides around <i>it</i> and its horns; and he made a rim of gold around <i>it.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> And he made for it two golden rings under its rim, on its two sides, on its opposite sides, as holders for poles with which to carry it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> And he made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> And he made the holy anointing oil and the pure fragrant incense, the work of a compounder.<br><br>

  <h4 id="exodus-38"><a onclick="open_chapter('top', '2-exodus.html')">Exodus 38</a></h4>
  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And he made the altar of burnt offering, of acacia wood; five cubits was its length, and five cubits, its width, square; and three cubits, its height.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And he made its horns upon its four corners; its horns were of <i>one piece with</i> it, and he overlaid it with bronze.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And he made all the utensils of the altar: the pots and the shovels and the basins, the forks and the firepans; all its utensils he made of bronze.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And he made a grating of network of bronze for the altar, under its ledge beneath, reaching halfway up.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And he cast four rings for the four ends of the grating of bronze, <i>as</i> holders for the poles.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And he made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with bronze.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And he put the poles into the rings on the sides of the altar, with which to carry it; he made it hollow, with boards.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And he made the laver of bronze and its base of bronze from the mirrors of the serving women who served at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> And he made the court. On the south side southward the hangings of the court were of fine twined linen, one hundred cubits;<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> Their twenty pillars and their twenty sockets were of bronze; the hooks of the pillars and their connecting rods were of silver.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And on the north side, one hundred cubits; their twenty pillars and their twenty sockets were of bronze; the hooks of the pillars and their connecting rods were of silver.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And on the west side there were hangings of fifty cubits, <i>with</i> their ten pillars and their ten sockets; the hooks of the pillars and their connecting rods were of silver.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> And <i>the width</i> of the east side eastward was fifty cubits.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> The hangings for the one side <i>of the gate</i> were fifteen cubits, <i>with</i> their three pillars and their three sockets;<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And so for the other side; on both sides of the gate of the court were hangings of fifteen cubits, <i>with</i> their three pillars and their three sockets.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> All the hangings around the court were of fine twined linen.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> And the sockets for the pillars were of bronze; the hooks of the pillars and their connecting rods were of silver; and the overlaying of their capitals was of silver; and all the pillars of the court were connected with silver.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> And the screen for the gate of the court was the work of an embroiderer, of blue and purple and scarlet <i>strands</i> and fine twined linen; and twenty cubits was the length, and the height in the width was five cubits, corresponding to the hangings of the court.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> And their four pillars and their four sockets were of bronze; their hooks were of silver, and the overlaying of their capitals and their connecting rods were of silver.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> And all the pegs of the tabernacle and of the court all around were of bronze.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> This is the sum of <i>the things for</i> the tabernacle, the Tabernacle of the Testimony, as they were counted according to the commandment of Moses for the service of the Levites by the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> And Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that Jehovah commanded Moses.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> And with him was Oholiab the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver and a skillful workman and an embroiderer in blue and in purple and in scarlet <i>strands</i> and in fine linen.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> All the gold that was used for the work, in all the work of the sanctuary, even the gold of the wave offering, was twenty-nine talents and seven hundred thirty shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> And the silver of those who were numbered of the assembly was one hundred talents and one thousand seven hundred seventy-five shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary;<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> A beka a head, <i>that is,</i> half a shekel, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, for each one who was enrolled among their numbering, from twenty years old and upward, for six hundred three thousand, five hundred fifty men.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> And the hundred talents of silver were for casting the sockets of the sanctuary and the sockets of the veil; one hundred sockets for the hundred talents, a talent for a socket.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> And of the one thousand seven hundred seventy-five <i>shekels</i> he made hooks for the pillars and overlaid their capitals and made connecting rods for them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> And the bronze of the wave offering was seventy talents, and two thousand four hundred shekels.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> And with it he made the sockets for the entrance of the Tent of Meeting and the bronze altar and the bronze grating for it and all the utensils of the altar<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> And the sockets around the court and the sockets of the gate of the court and all the pegs of the tabernacle and all the pegs around the court.<br><br>
