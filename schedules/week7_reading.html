  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Sanctify to Me all the firstborn: Whatever opens the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast, it is Mine.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And Moses said to the people, Remember this day on which you came out from Egypt, from the slave house, for by strength of hand Jehovah brought you out from this place; and nothing leavened shall be eaten.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> On this day in the month of Abib you are going out.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And when Jehovah brings you into the land of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Hivites and the Jebusites, which He swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, you shall observe this service in this month:<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall be a feast to Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days, and nothing leavened shall be seen with you, nor shall any leaven be seen with you in all your territory.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And you shall tell your son in that day, saying, It is because of what Jehovah did for me when I came out of Egypt.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> And it shall be for a sign to you upon your hand and for a memorial between your eyes, that the law of Jehovah may be in your mouth; for with a mighty hand Jehovah brought you out of Egypt.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> You shall therefore keep this statute at its appointed time from year to year.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And when Jehovah brings you into the land of the Canaanites, as He swore to you and to your fathers, and gives it to you,<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> You shall set apart to Jehovah everything that opens the womb and the first offspring of every beast which is yours; the males shall be Jehovah’s.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> And every first <i>offspring</i> of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb; and if you do not redeem <i>it,</i> you shall break its neck. And every firstborn male among your sons you shall redeem.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> And when your son asks you in time to come, saying, What is this? you shall say to him, By strength of hand Jehovah brought us out from Egypt, from the slave house.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And when Pharaoh hardened himself against letting us go, Jehovah slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man and the firstborn of beast. Therefore I am one who sacrifices to Jehovah every male that opens the womb; and all the firstborn of my sons I redeem.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> So it will be as a sign upon your hand and as frontlets between your eyes, for by strength of hand Jehovah brought us out of Egypt.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> Now when Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them by the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Perhaps the people will change their minds when they see war and will return to Egypt.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> Thus God led the people around by the way of the wilderness to the Red Sea. And the children of Israel went up arrayed for battle out of the land of Egypt.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for <i>Joseph</i> had made the children of Israel solemnly swear, saying, God will surely visit you, and you shall bring my bones up from here with you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> And they journeyed from Succoth and encamped in Etham on the edge of the wilderness.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And Jehovah went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them on the way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, that they might go by day and by night.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> Neither the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night departed from before the people.<br><br>

  <h4 id="exodus-14"><a onclick="open_chapter('top', '2-exodus.html')">Exodus 14</a></h4>
  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Tell the children of Israel to turn back and camp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea. You shall camp before Baal-zephon, opposite it, by the sea.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are wandering aimlessly in the land; the wilderness has hemmed them in.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and he will pursue after them; and I will glorify Myself through Pharaoh and through all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am Jehovah. And they did so.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And when it was told to the king of Egypt that the people had fled, the heart of Pharaoh and his servants changed toward the people; and they said, What is this we have done, letting Israel go from serving us?<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> So he yoked his chariot and took his people with him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And he took six hundred chosen chariots and all the <i>other</i> chariots of Egypt with officers over all of them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And Jehovah hardened the heart of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, so that he pursued after the children of Israel as the children of Israel were going out boldly.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> And the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses <i>and</i> chariots of Pharaoh and his horsemen and his army; and they overtook them as they encamped by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, before Baal-zephon.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And when Pharaoh approached, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and there the Egyptians were, marching after them; and they became very afraid, and the children of Israel cried out to Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And they said to Moses, Is it because there were no graves in Egypt that you have taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why have you done this to us, bringing us out of Egypt?<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> Is this not the very thing that we spoke to you about in Egypt, saying, Leave us alone that we may serve the Egyptians? For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> But Moses said to the people, Do not be afraid; stand firm, and see the salvation of Jehovah, which He will accomplish for you today; for the Egyptians whom you have seen today, you will see no more again forever.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> Jehovah will fight for you, and you will be still.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And Jehovah said to Moses, Why do you cry out to Me? Tell the children of Israel to move forward.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And you, lift up your staff, and stretch out your hand over the sea, and divide it; and the children of Israel shall go into the midst of the sea on dry ground.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> And I will now harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they will go in after them; and I will glorify Myself through Pharaoh and through all his army, through his chariots and through his horsemen.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> Then the Egyptians will know that I am Jehovah when I glorify Myself through Pharaoh, through his chariots and through his horsemen.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> And the Angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud moved from before them and stood behind them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel. And the cloud was there with the darkness, yet it gave light by night <i>to them.</i> Thus one did not come near the other all night.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And when Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, Jehovah caused the sea to go <i>back</i> by a strong east wind all the night and made the sea dry land; and the waters were divided.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> Then the Egyptians pursued; and all Pharaoh’s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen went in after them into the midst of the sea.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> And at the morning watch Jehovah looked down upon the camp of the Egyptians <i>from</i> within the pillar of fire and of cloud and threw the camp of the Egyptians into confusion.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> And He caused their chariot wheels to swerve and made them drive with difficulty, so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from Israel, for Jehovah is fighting for them against the Egyptians.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> And Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch out your hand over the sea so that the waters come back over the Egyptians, over their chariots and over their horsemen.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its level when the morning appeared. And the Egyptians fled against it, and Jehovah cast the Egyptians off into the midst of the sea.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> And as the waters returned, they covered the chariots and the horsemen, even all the army of Pharaoh that went in after them into the sea; not even one of them was left.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> But the children of Israel walked on dry land through the midst of the sea, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> Thus Jehovah saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the seashore.<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> And when Israel saw the great power which Jehovah exercised against the Egyptians, the people feared Jehovah; and they believed in Jehovah and in His servant Moses.<br><br>
