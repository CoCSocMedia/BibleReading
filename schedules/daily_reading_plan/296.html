  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> I waited patiently on Jehovah, / And He inclined to me / And heard my cry.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Then He brought me up out of a pit of destruction, / Out of the miry clay; / And He set my feet upon a rock, / Establishing my steps.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> Then He put a new song in my mouth, / A praise to our God. / Many see <i>it</i> and fear, / And they trust in Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Blessed is the man / Who makes Jehovah his trust / And does not turn to the proud / Or to those who turn aside after deception.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> Many, O Jehovah my God, are the wonderful deeds which You have done / And Your thoughts toward us; / They cannot be set in order unto You. / Were I to declare and speak of them, / They would be too numerous to recount.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> You do not delight in sacrifice and offering; / You have prepared ears for Me; / You do not require burnt offering and sin offering.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Then I said, / Behold, I have come; / In the scroll of the book / It is written concerning Me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> I delight in doing Your will, O My God; / Indeed Your law is within My inward parts.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> I bear tidings of righteousness / In the great congregation. / Behold, I will not withhold My lips; / O Jehovah, You know.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> I have not hidden Your righteousness / Within My heart; / I have declared Your faithfulness and Your salvation; / I have not concealed Your lovingkindness and Your truth from the great congregation.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> You, O Jehovah, do not withhold / Your compassions from me; / May Your lovingkindness and Your truth / Preserve me continually.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> For evils encompass me until they cannot be counted; / My iniquities have so overtaken me / That I cannot see; / They are more numerous than the hairs of my head; / Thus my heart fails me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> Be pleased, O Jehovah, to deliver me; / O Jehovah, hasten to help me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> May those who seek my life to destroy it / Be put to shame and confounded together; / May those who take delight in my misfortune / Be turned back and humiliated.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> May those who say to me, Aha! Aha! / Be desolate because of their shame.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> May all those who seek You / Be glad and rejoice in You; / May those who love Your salvation say continually, / May Jehovah be magnified!<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> But I am poor and needy; / May the Lord think about me. / You are my help and my Deliverer; / O my God, do not delay.<br><br>
