  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Should a wise man answer with the knowledge of wind, / And should he fill his belly with the east wind?<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> Should he argue with useless talk / And with words by which he cannot avail?<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Indeed you do away with the fear <i>of God</i> / And restrain meditation before God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> For your iniquity instructs your mouth, / And you choose the tongue of the crafty.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> Your own mouth condemns you, and not I; / And your own lips testify against you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Are you the first man born? / Or were you brought forth before the hills?<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> Did you listen in on the secret council of God? / And do you limit wisdom to yourself?<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> What do you know that we do not know? / <i>What</i> do you understand that is not with us?<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> Both the grayheaded and the aged are among us, / Older than your father.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> Are the consolations of God too small for you, / Or the word <i>spoken</i> gently to you?<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> Why does your heart take you away? / And why do your eyes flash,<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> That you turn your spirit against God / And let words go forth from your mouth?<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> What is mortal man, that he can be clean, / Or he who is born of a woman, that he can be righteous?<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> Indeed, He puts no trust in His holy ones; / Even the heavens are not clean in His eyes.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> How much less one who is abominable and corrupt! / <i>How much less</i> a man who drinks wrong like water!<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> I will tell you; hear me; / And what I have seen, that will I recount,<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> What wise men have declared, / And have not hidden, from their fathers;<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> To whom alone the land was given, / And no stranger passed in their midst:<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> For all his days the wicked man travails in pain, / And numbered years are stored up for the ruthless man.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> The sound of terrors is in his ears; / While <i>he is</i> at peace, the destroyer will come upon him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> He does not believe that he will return from the darkness, / And he is spied out for the sword.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> He wanders for bread — where is it? / He knows that the day of darkness is ready at hand.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> Distress and straits terrify him; / They prevail against him, like a king prepared for the attack;<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> Because he stretched out his hand against God, / And against the Almighty he acted mightily,<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> Running against Him with a stiff neck, / With the thick bosses of his shield;<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> Because he covered his face with his fatness / And gathered fat upon his loins;<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> And he dwelt in desolated cities, / In houses which should not have been inhabited, / Which were appointed to become heaps.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> He will not be rich, and his wealth will not endure; / Nor will his produce bend down to the earth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> He will not go away from darkness; / The flame will dry up his shoots, / And by the breath of His mouth he will go away.<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> Let him not trust in vanity, deceiving himself; / For vanity will be his recompense.<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> It will be fully paid before his day, / And his branch will not be flourishing.<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> He will shake off his unripe grapes like a vine, / And he will cast off his blossom like an olive tree.<br><br>
     <sup><b>34</b></sup> For the company of the profane will be barren, / And fire will devour the tents of bribery.<br><br>
     <sup><b>35</b></sup> They conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity, / And their heart prepares deceit.<br><br>
