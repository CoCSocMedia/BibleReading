  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, <i>As to</i> the appointed feasts of Jehovah, which you shall proclaim as holy convocations, these are My appointed feasts.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> Six days work shall be done, but on the seventh day there is a Sabbath of complete rest, a holy convocation. You shall do no work; it is a Sabbath to Jehovah in all your dwelling places.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> These are the appointed feasts of Jehovah, even the holy convocations, which you shall proclaim at their appointed time:<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> In the first month, on the fourteenth <i>day</i> of the month at twilight, is Jehovah’s Passover,<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And on the fifteenth day of this month is the Feast of Unleavened Bread to Jehovah; seven days you shall eat unleavened bread.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> On the first day you shall have a holy convocation; you shall do no work of labor.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> But you shall present an offering by fire to Jehovah seven days. On the seventh day there shall be a holy convocation; you shall do no work of labor.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When you come into the land which I am giving you, and reap its harvest, then you shall bring the sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest to the priest;<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And he shall wave the sheaf before Jehovah for your acceptance; on the day after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And on the day when you wave the sheaf, you shall offer a male lamb a year old without blemish as a burnt offering to Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> And its meal offering shall be two-tenths <i>of an ephah</i> of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering by fire to Jehovah for a satisfying fragrance. And its drink offering shall be of wine, a fourth of a hin.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> And you shall eat no bread or parched grain or fresh ears until that same day, until you have brought the offering of your God. It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwelling places.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And you shall count for yourselves from the day after the Sabbath; from the day that you brought the sheaf of the wave offering there shall be seven complete Sabbaths.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> You shall count fifty days until the day after the seventh Sabbath; then you shall present a new meal offering to Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> You shall bring out of your dwelling places two loaves as a wave offering; they shall be of two tenths <i>of an ephah</i> of fine flour, baked with leaven, as firstfruits to Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> And you shall present with the bread seven lambs, a year old without blemish, and one bull of the herd and two rams; they shall be a burnt offering to Jehovah with their meal offering and their drink offerings, an offering by fire for a satisfying fragrance to Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> And you shall offer one male goat for a sin offering and two male lambs, a year old, for a sacrifice of peace offerings.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits as a wave offering before Jehovah with the two lambs; they shall be holy to Jehovah for the priest.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And you shall make a proclamation on that same day; you shall have a holy convocation; you shall do no work of labor. It shall be a perpetual statute in all your dwelling places throughout your generations.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> And when you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not completely reap the corners of your field, nor shall you gather the gleanings of your harvest; you shall leave them for the poor and for the sojourner; I am Jehovah your God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> Speak to the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you shall have a complete rest, a memorial <i>commemorated by</i> the blowing <i>of trumpets,</i> a holy convocation.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> You shall do no work of labor, but you shall present an offering by fire to Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> And on the tenth day of this seventh month is the Day of Expiation; you shall have a holy convocation, and you shall afflict your souls and present an offering by fire to Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> And you shall do no work on that same day, because it is a Day of Expiation, to make expiation on your behalf before Jehovah your God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> If there is any person who does not afflict himself on that same day, he shall be cut off from his people.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> And if any person does any work on that same day, I will destroy that person from among his people.<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> You shall do no work; it shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwelling places.<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> It shall be to you a Sabbath of complete rest, and you shall afflict your souls; on the ninth day of the month in the evening, from evening to evening, you shall keep your Sabbath.<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br><br>
     <sup><b>34</b></sup> Speak to the children of Israel, saying, On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the Feast of Tabernacles for seven days to Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>35</b></sup> On the first day shall be a holy convocation; you shall do no work of labor.<br><br>
     <sup><b>36</b></sup> Seven days you shall present an offering by fire to Jehovah. On the eighth day you shall have a holy convocation, and you shall present an offering by fire to Jehovah. It is a solemn assembly; you shall do no work of labor.<br><br>
     <sup><b>37</b></sup> These are the appointed feasts of Jehovah, which you shall proclaim as holy convocations, to present an offering by fire to Jehovah, burnt offerings and meal offerings, sacrifices and drink offerings, each on its own day,<br><br>
     <sup><b>38</b></sup> Besides the Sabbaths of Jehovah and besides your gifts and besides all your vows and besides all your freewill offerings which you give to Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>39</b></sup> Then on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the produce of the land, you shall keep the feast of Jehovah seven days; on the first day shall be a complete rest, and on the eighth day shall be a complete rest.<br><br>
     <sup><b>40</b></sup> And on the first day you shall take for yourselves the product of stately trees, branches of palm trees and boughs of leafy trees and willows of the brook; and you shall rejoice before Jehovah your God for seven days.<br><br>
     <sup><b>41</b></sup> And you shall keep it as a feast to Jehovah seven days in the year. It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations; you shall keep it in the seventh month.<br><br>
     <sup><b>42</b></sup> You shall dwell in booths seven days — all who are native in Israel shall dwell in booths —<br><br>
     <sup><b>43</b></sup> So that your descendants may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt; I am Jehovah your God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>44</b></sup> And Moses declared to the children of Israel the appointed feasts of Jehovah.<br><br>
