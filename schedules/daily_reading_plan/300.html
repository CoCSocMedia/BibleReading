  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> O God, we have heard with our ears; / Our fathers have recounted <i>it</i> to us, / The work You did in their days, / In the days of old.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> You, by Your hand, / Have dispossessed nations, but You have planted our fathers; / You afflicted peoples, but You spread our fathers forth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> For they did not possess the land by their sword, / Nor did their arm save them; / Rather <i>it was</i> Your right hand and Your arm, / And the light of Your countenance; / For You delighted in them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> You are my King, O God; / Command salvation for Jacob.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> Through You we thrust back our adversaries; / Through Your name we trample those who rise up against us.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> For I will not trust in my bow, / Nor will my sword save me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> But You save us from our adversaries, / And You put to shame those who hate us.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> In God we boast all day long, / And we praise Your name forever. Selah<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> Nevertheless You have rejected <i>us</i> and humiliated us, / And You have not gone forth with our armies.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> You have caused us to turn back from the adversary, / And those who hate us take spoil for themselves.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> You have given us over like sheep to be eaten / And have scattered us among the nations.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> You have sold Your people for nothing / And have not gone high on their price.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> You have made us a reproach to our neighbors, / A mocking and a derision to those around us.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> You have made us a proverb among the nations, / Something to shake the head at among the peoples.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> All day long my humiliation is before me, / And the shame of my face covers me,<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> Because of the voice of him who reproaches and reviles, / Because of the presence of the enemy and of him who avenges himself.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> All this has come upon us; but we have not forgotten You, / Nor have we been false to Your covenant.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> Our heart has not turned back, / Nor have our steps deviated from Your way;<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> But You have crushed us in the place of jackals / And have covered us with the shadow of death.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> If we have forgotten the name of our God / Or spread out our hands to a strange god,<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> Will God not search this out? / For He knows the hidden things of the heart.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> But for Your sake we are slain all day long; / We are considered as sheep for slaughter.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> Awake! Why are You sleeping, O Lord? / Arise! Do not reject <i>us</i> forever.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> Why do You hide Your face / <i>And</i> forget our affliction and our oppression?<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> For our soul bows down to the dust; / Our body clings to the earth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> Rise up; be our help, / And redeem us for Your lovingkindness’ sake.<br><br>
