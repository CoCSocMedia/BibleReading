  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Do you know the time when the mountain goats bring forth? / Can you mark <i>the time</i> when the hinds calve?<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Can you number the months that they must fulfill? / Or do you know the time when they bring forth?<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> They crouch down; they give birth to their young ones; / They send forth their offspring.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Their young become strong; they grow up in the open field; / They go forth and do not return to them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> Who has sent out the wild ass free? / Or who has loosed the bonds of the swift ass,<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> Whose home I have made the wilderness, / And the salt land, his dwelling place?<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> He scorns the tumult of the city; / He does not hear the shouts of the driver.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> He searches out the mountains for his pasture / And seeks after every green thing.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> Will the wild ox be willing to serve you / Or spend the night by your manger?<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> Can you bind the wild ox to the furrows with his ropes? / Or will he plow the valleys behind you?<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> Will you trust in him because his strength is great? / Or will you leave your labor to him?<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> Will you have confidence in him that he will bring in your seed / And gather <i>your grain</i> to your threshing floor?<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> The wings of the ostrich flap joyously: / Are they the pinion and plumage of lovingkindness?<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> For she leaves her eggs on the earth / And warms them in the dust.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And she forgets that a foot may crush them / Or that an animal of the field may trample them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> She is hard with her children, as if they were not hers; / Though her labor may be in vain, <i>she has</i> no fear;<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> Because God has caused her to forget wisdom / And has not appointed understanding to her.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> At that time when she lifts herself up on high, / She scorns the horse and its rider.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> Have you given the horse <i>his</i> might? / Have you clothed his neck with the quivering mane?<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> Have you made him to leap like a locust? / His majestic snorting is terrible.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> He paws in the valley, / And he rejoices in <i>his</i> strength; / He goes forth to meet weapons.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> He laughs at fear and is not dismayed, / And he does not turn back from the sword.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> A quiver <i>of arrows</i> rattles against him, / The flashing spear and the javelin.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> With fierceness and rage he swallows the ground, / And he cannot stand still at the sound of the trumpet.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> As often as the trumpet <i>sounds,</i> he says, Aha! / And from afar he smells the battle, / The thundering of captains and the shouting.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> Is it by your understanding that the hawk soars, / Stretching his wings to the south?<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> Is it at your command that the eagle mounts up / And makes his nest on high?<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> On the cliff he dwells and makes his lodging, / Upon the point of the cliff and the stronghold.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> From there he spies out food; / His eyes gaze on <i>it</i> from afar.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> And his young ones suck up the blood; / And where the slain are, there he is.<br><br>
