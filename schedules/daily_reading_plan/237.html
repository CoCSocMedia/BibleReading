  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Speak to the children of Israel, saying, If anyone sins without intent, in any of the things which Jehovah has commanded not to be done, and does any one of them,<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> If the anointed priest sins so as to bring guilt on the people, then let him present a bull of the herd without blemish to Jehovah for a sin offering for his sin that he committed.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And he shall bring the bull to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting before Jehovah, and he shall lay his hand on the head of the bull and slaughter the bull before Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And the anointed priest shall take some of the blood of the bull and bring it into the Tent of Meeting,<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle some of the blood seven times before Jehovah in front of the veil of the sanctuary.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And the priest shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of fragrant incense before Jehovah, which is in the Tent of Meeting; and all <i>the rest of</i> the blood of the bull he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering, which is at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And all the fat of the bull of the sin offering he shall take off from it: the fat that covers the inward parts and all the fat that is upon the inward parts,<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> And the two kidneys and the fat that is on them, which is on the loins, and the appendage upon the liver, which he shall remove with the kidneys,<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> As it is taken off from the ox of the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall burn them on the altar of burnt offering.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And the skin of the bull and all its flesh with its head and with its legs, and <i>the rest of</i> its inward parts and its dung,<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> That is, all <i>the rest of</i> the bull he shall bring out to a clean place outside the camp, where the ashes are poured out, and burn it on wood with fire; where the ashes are poured out it shall be burned.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> Now if the whole assembly of Israel errs, and the matter escapes the notice of the congregation, and they have done any of the things which Jehovah commanded not to be done and become guilty,<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> And when the sin which they have committed becomes known, the congregation shall present a bull of the herd for a sin offering and bring it before the Tent of Meeting.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And the elders of the assembly shall lay their hands on the head of the bull before Jehovah, and one shall slaughter the bull before Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And the anointed priest shall bring some of the blood of the bull to the Tent of Meeting,<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle <i>it</i> seven times before Jehovah in front of the veil.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> And some of the blood he shall put upon the horns of the altar which is before Jehovah, that is, in the Tent of Meeting; and all <i>the rest of</i> the blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering, which is at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> And all its fat he shall take off from it and burn <i>it</i> on the altar.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> Thus shall he do with the bull; just as he did with the bull of the sin offering, so shall he do with this. And the priest shall make expiation for them, and they will be forgiven.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And he shall bring the bull outside the camp and burn it as he burned the first bull; it is the sin offering for the congregation.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> When a ruler sins and does without intent any one of all the things which Jehovah his God has commanded not to be done and becomes guilty,<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> If his sin in which he has sinned is made known to him, he shall bring for his offering a male goat, without blemish.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> And he shall lay his hand on the head of the goat and slaughter it in the place where they slaughter the burnt offering before Jehovah; it is a sin offering.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> And the priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put <i>it</i> on the horns of the altar of burnt offering; and <i>the rest of</i> its blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> And all its fat he shall burn on the altar, like the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings. And the priest shall make expiation for him on account of his sin, and he will be forgiven.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> And if any one of the common people sins without intent by doing any one of the things which Jehovah has commanded not to be done and becomes guilty,<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> If his sin which he has committed is made known to him, he shall bring for his offering a female goat, without blemish, for his sin which he has committed.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> And he shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slaughter the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> And the priest shall take some of its blood with his finger and put <i>it</i> on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and all <i>the rest of</i> its blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar.<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> And all its fat he shall remove, just as the fat is removed from the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall burn <i>it</i> on the altar for a satisfying fragrance to Jehovah. And the priest shall make expiation for him, and he will be forgiven.<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> And if he brings a lamb as his offering for a sin offering, he shall bring it, a female without blemish.<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> And he shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slaughter it for a sin offering in the place where they slaughter the burnt offering.<br><br>
     <sup><b>34</b></sup> And the priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put <i>it</i> on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and all <i>the rest of</i> its blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar.<br><br>
     <sup><b>35</b></sup> And all its fat he shall remove, just as the fat of the lamb is removed from the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall burn them on the altar upon Jehovah’s offerings by fire. And the priest shall make expiation for him concerning his sin that he has committed, and he will be forgiven.<br><br>
