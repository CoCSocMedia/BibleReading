  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then Job answered and said,<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Today also my complaint is bitter; / My stroke is heavy because of my groaning.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> Oh that I knew where I might find Him, / That I might come to His seat!<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> I would present <i>my</i> cause in order before Him, / And I would fill my mouth with arguments.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> I would know the words which He would answer me, / And I would understand what He would speak to me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> Would He contend with me in the greatness of <i>His</i> power? / No; but He would give heed to me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> There the upright man can argue with Him; / So I would be delivered forever from my Judge.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> Behold, I go forward, but He is not there; / And backward, but I do not perceive Him;<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> To the left, where He acts, but I cannot look on <i>Him;</i> / He hides Himself on the right, so I cannot see Him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> But He knows the way that I take; / Should He try me, I would come forth as gold.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> My foot has held fast to His steps; / I have kept His way and have not turned aside.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> As for the commandment of His lips, I have not turned back from <i>it;</i> / I have treasured the words of His mouth more than my apportioned food.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> But He is of one <i>mind,</i> and who can turn Him? / And what His soul desires, that will He do.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> For He performs what has been appointed to me, / And many such things are with Him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> Therefore I am terrified at His presence; / I consider and am in dread of Him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> So God has made my heart faint, / And the Almighty has terrified me;<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> Because I was not cut off before the darkness, / Nor did He cover the deep darkness from my face.<br><br>
