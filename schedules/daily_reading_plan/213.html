  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And you shall make an altar on which to burn incense; you shall make it of acacia wood.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Its length shall be a cubit, and its width, a cubit; it shall be square, and two cubits its height; its horns shall be of <i>one piece with</i> it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And you shall overlay it with pure gold, its top and its sides around <i>it</i> and its horns; and you shall make a rim of gold around <i>it.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And you shall make for it two rings of gold under its rim; on its two sides, on its opposite sides, you shall make <i>them;</i> and they shall be as holders for poles with which to carry it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And you shall make the poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And you shall put it before the veil that is over the Ark of the Testimony, before the expiation cover that is over the Testimony, where I will meet with you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And Aaron shall burn on it fragrant incense; every morning when he dresses the lamps he shall burn it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And when Aaron sets up the lamps at twilight, he shall burn it, a perpetual incense before Jehovah throughout your generations.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> You shall not offer any strange incense on it, or a burnt offering or a meal offering; and you shall not pour a drink offering on it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And Aaron shall make expiation on its horns once a year; with the blood of the sin offering of expiation once a year he shall make expiation for it throughout your generations. It is most holy to Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> When you take the sum of the children of Israel, according to their numbering, every man shall give a ransom for himself to Jehovah when you number them, that there may be no plague among them when you number them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> This they shall give, each one who was enrolled among their numbering, half a shekel according to the shekel of the sanctuary (the shekel is twenty gerahs), half a shekel as a heave offering to Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> Each one who was enrolled among their numbering, from twenty years old and over, shall give the heave offering of Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> The rich shall not give more and the poor shall not give less than the half shekel when you give the heave offering of Jehovah to make expiation for your souls.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And you shall take the expiation silver from the children of Israel and shall give it for the service of the Tent of Meeting, that it may be a memorial for the children of Israel before Jehovah to make expiation for your souls.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> You shall also make a laver of bronze, with its base of bronze, for washing. And you shall put it between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and you shall put water in it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> And Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet <i>with water</i> from it;<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> When they go into the Tent of Meeting, they shall wash with water, that they may not die; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn an offering by fire to Jehovah,<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> They shall wash their hands and their feet, that they may not die. And it shall be a perpetual statute to them, for him and for his seed throughout their generations.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> Moreover Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> You also take the finest spices: of flowing myrrh five hundred <i>shekels,</i> and of fragrant cinnamon half as much, two hundred fifty <i>shekels,</i> and of fragrant calamus two hundred fifty <i>shekels,</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> And of cassia five hundred <i>shekels,</i> according to the shekel of the sanctuary, and a hin of olive oil.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> And you shall make it a holy anointing oil, a fragrant ointment compounded according to the work of a compounder; it shall be a holy anointing oil.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> And with it you shall anoint the Tent of Meeting and the Ark of the Testimony,<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> And the table and all its utensils, and the lampstand and its utensils, and the altar of incense,<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> And the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the laver and its base.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> Thus you shall sanctify them that they may be most holy; whatever touches them shall be holy.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> And you shall anoint Aaron and his sons and sanctify them that they may serve Me as priests.<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> And you shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, This shall be a holy anointing oil to Me throughout your generations.<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> Upon the flesh of man it shall not be poured, nor shall you make <i>any</i> like it, according to its composition; it is holy, <i>and</i> it shall be holy to you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> Whoever compounds <i>any</i> like it or whoever puts any of it upon a stranger, he shall be cut off from his people.<br><br>
     <sup><b>34</b></sup> And Jehovah said to Moses, Take fragrant spices — stacte and onycha and galbanum — fragrant spices with pure frankincense; there shall be an equal part of each;<br><br>
     <sup><b>35</b></sup> And you shall make of it incense, a fragrant compound according to the work of a compounder, seasoned with salt, pure <i>and</i> holy.<br><br>
     <sup><b>36</b></sup> And you shall beat some of it very fine, and put some of it before the Testimony in the Tent of Meeting, where I will meet with you; it shall be to you most holy.<br><br>
     <sup><b>37</b></sup> And the incense which you shall make, you shall not make for yourselves according to its composition; it shall be holy to you for Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>38</b></sup> Whoever shall make <i>any</i> like it, to smell it, shall be cut off from his people.<br><br>
