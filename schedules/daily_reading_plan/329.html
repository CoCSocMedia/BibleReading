  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Surely God is good to Israel, / To those who are pure in heart.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> But as for me, my feet were nearly turned aside; / My steps had almost slipped.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> For I was envious of the arrogant, / <i>When</i> I saw the prosperity of the wicked.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> For they have no pangs in their death, / And their body is well nourished.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> They do not <i>find themselves</i> in the hardship of men, / Nor are they plagued like <i>other</i> men.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> Therefore pride is a necklace for them, / Violence covers them like a garment.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Their eyes bulge out from fatness; / The imaginations of <i>their</i> heart overflow.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> They mock and wickedly speak of oppression; / They speak loftily.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> They set their mouth against the heavens, / And their tongue walks about on the earth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> Therefore His people return here, / And waters of abundance are drained by them;<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And they say, How does God know? / And is there knowledge with the Most High?<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> Behold, these are the wicked; / And always at ease, they heap up riches.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> Surely I have purified my heart in vain, / And I have washed my hands in innocence.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> For I have been plagued all day long / And chastened every morning.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> If I had said, I will speak thus; / Behold, I would have betrayed the generation of Your children.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> When I considered this in order to understand <i>it,</i> / It was a troublesome task in my sight,<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> Until I went into the sanctuary of God; / <i>Then</i> I perceived their end.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> Surely You set them in slippery places; / You cast them down into ruins.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> How they are made desolate in a moment! / They are utterly consumed by terrors.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> Like a dream, when one awakes, You, O Lord, / Upon arising, will despise their image.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> When my heart was embittered, / And inwardly I was pricked;<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> I was brutish and knew nothing; / I was <i>like</i> a beast before You.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> Nevertheless I am continually with You; / You have taken hold of my right hand.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> You will guide me with Your counsel, / And afterward You will receive me in glory.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> Whom do I have in heaven <i>but You?</i> / And besides You there is nothing I desire on earth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> My flesh and my heart fail, / <i>But</i> God is the rock of my heart and my portion forever.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> For behold, those who are far from You will perish; / You destroy all who go about as harlots away from You.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> But as for me, drawing near to God is good for me; / I have made the Lord Jehovah my refuge, / That I may declare all Your works.<br><br>
