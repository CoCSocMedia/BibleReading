  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And Jehovah answered Job and said,<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Shall one who finds fault contend with the Almighty? / Let him who argues with God answer it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> Then Job answered Jehovah and said,<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Indeed, I am worthless. What shall I reply to You? / I lay my hand over my mouth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> I have spoken once, and I will not answer; / And twice, and I will proceed no further.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And Jehovah answered Job out of the whirlwind and said,<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Gird up now your loins like a mighty man; / For I will ask of you, and you shall inform Me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> Will you indeed annul My judgment? / Will you condemn Me so that you may be justified?<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> Or do you have an arm like God’s, / And can you thunder with a voice like His?<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> Deck yourself now with majesty and excellency, / And array yourself with honor and splendor.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> Pour forth the overflowings of your anger, / And look upon everyone who is proud, and abase him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> Look upon everyone who is proud; bring him down; / And tread down the wicked where they stand.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> Hide them in the dust together; / Bind their faces in the hidden place.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> Then even I will praise you, / That your own right hand can save you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> Behold now the behemoth, which I made as well as you: / He eats grass like the ox.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> Behold now, his strength is in his loins, / And his power is in the muscles of his belly.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> He bends his tail like a cedar; / The sinews of his thighs knit together.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> His bones are like bronze tubes; / His limbs, like iron bars.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> He is the first of God’s ways; / <i>Only</i> his Maker can approach <i>him</i> with His sword.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> For the mountains yield food for him, / Where every animal of the field plays.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> Under the lotus plants he lies down, / In the covert of the reed and the marsh.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> The lotus plants cover him with their shade; / The willows of the brook surround him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> Indeed, if a river overflows, he does not tremble; / He is confident, though the Jordan rushes against his mouth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> Will anyone catch him while he is watching, / Or pierce <i>his</i> nose with a snare?<br><br>
