  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> At this, too, my heart trembles / And leaps from its place.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Hear attentively the noise of His voice / And the sound that goes forth from His mouth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> He sends it forth under the whole heaven, / And His lightning unto the ends of the earth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> After it a voice roars; / He thunders with the voice of His majesty / And does not withhold the lightning / When His voice is heard.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> God thunders wondrously with His voice; / He does great things that we cannot comprehend.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> For He says to the snow, Fall on the earth, / And to the rain shower and His mighty showers of rain.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> He seals the hand of every man, / That all men may know His doing.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> Then the beast enters its lair / And remains in its dens.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> Out of <i>its</i> chamber comes the whirlwind, / And from scattering winds, cold.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> From the breath of God ice is yielded, / And the expanse of waters is frozen.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> He also loads the thick clouds with moisture; / He scatters His lightning clouds;<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And they turn about by His guidance, / That they may accomplish / All that He has commanded them / Upon the surface of the inhabited earth;<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> Whether for scourge or for His land / Or for lovingkindness’ sake, He causes it to happen.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> Give ear to this, Job; / Stand still and consider the wondrous acts of God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> Do you know how God lays <i>His charge</i> upon them / And causes His lightning clouds to shine?<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> Do you know about the balancing of the thick clouds, / The wondrous acts of Him who is perfect in knowledge?<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> You whose garments heat up / When, because of the south wind, the earth is still,<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> Can you spread out the skies with Him, / <i>The skies</i> which are as hard as a molten mirror?<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> Teach us what to say to Him; / We cannot arrange <i>our words</i> because of the darkness.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> Should it be said to Him, I will speak? / Or should a man say that he will be swallowed up?<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> But now men do not look at the light, / Which is brilliant in the skies / When the wind has passed and cleared them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> Out of the north comes golden splendor; / Upon God is the awesomeness of majesty.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> The Almighty — we cannot find Him out; / He is excellent in power, / And justice and the abundance of righteousness He will not damage.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> Therefore men fear Him; / He does not look upon any who are wise of heart.<br><br>
