  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, I am Jehovah your God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> You shall not do as <i>they</i> do in the land of Egypt, in which you dwelt; and you shall not do as <i>they</i> do in the land of Canaan, where I am bringing you, nor shall you walk in their statutes.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> You shall observe My ordinances, and you shall keep My statutes to walk in them; I am Jehovah your God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> So you shall keep My statutes and My ordinances, by which, if a man does <i>them,</i> he will live; I am Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> None of you shall approach to any of his close relatives to uncover <i>their</i> nakedness; I am Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> The nakedness of your father, that is, the nakedness of your mother, you shall not uncover. She is your mother; you shall not uncover her nakedness.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> The nakedness of your father’s wife you shall not uncover; it is your father’s nakedness.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> The nakedness of your sister, your father’s daughter, or your mother’s daughter, whether born at home or born abroad, their nakedness you shall not uncover.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> The nakedness of your son’s daughter or of your daughter’s daughter, their nakedness you shall not uncover; for their <i>nakedness</i> is your own nakedness.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> The nakedness of your father’s wife’s daughter, begotten of your father — she is your sister — you shall not uncover her nakedness.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s sister; she is your father’s flesh.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> You shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother’s sister, for she is your mother’s flesh.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s brother, <i>that is,</i> you shall not approach his wife; she is your aunt.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> You shall not uncover the nakedness of your daughter-in-law; she is your son’s wife; you shall not uncover her nakedness.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> You shall not uncover the nakedness of your brother’s wife; it is your brother’s nakedness.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter; you shall not take her son’s daughter or her daughter’s daughter to uncover her nakedness; they are <i>her</i> flesh; it is wickedness.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> And you shall not take <i>a woman as</i> wife in addition to her sister, as a rival to uncover her nakedness while she is alive.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> And you shall not approach a woman to uncover her nakedness while she is in her menstrual uncleanness.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> And you shall not have sexual relations with the wife of your fellow countryman to become defiled with her.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And you shall not give any of your offspring to pass through <i>the fire</i> to Molech, and so profane the name of your God; I am Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a woman; it is an abomination.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> And you shall not lie with any beast to defile yourself with it; neither shall any woman stand before a beast, to lie down with it; it is confusion.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> Do not defile yourselves in any of these things, for by all these the nations which I am casting out before you have defiled themselves.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> Because the land has become defiled, I visited its iniquity upon it, and the land vomited out its inhabitants.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> You therefore shall keep My statutes and My ordinances, and shall not do any of these abominations, <i>neither</i> the native nor the sojourner who sojourns among you<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> (For the men of the land who were before you have done all these abominations, and the land has become defiled);<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> That the land does not vomit you out when you defile it, as it vomited out the nation which was before you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> For all who do any of these abominations, those persons who do <i>them</i> shall be cut off from among their people.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> Therefore you shall keep My charge, so that you do not commit any of these abominable customs which were committed before you, and you do not defile yourselves by them; I am Jehovah your God.<br><br>
