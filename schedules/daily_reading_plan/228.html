  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Man, born of woman, / Is of few days and full of trouble.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> He comes forth like a blossom and is cut down, / He also flees like a shadow and does not remain.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And do You open Your eyes upon such a one / And bring me into litigation with You?<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Who can bring a clean thing out from the unclean? / No one!<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> Since his days are determined, / <i>And</i> the number of his months is with You; / <i>Since</i> You have appointed his bounds, and he cannot go beyond;<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> Look away from him that he may rest, / Until he fulfills his day like a hired hand.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> For there is hope for a tree: / If it is cut down, it will sprout again, / And its tender shoot will not cease.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> Though its root grows old in the earth, / And its trunk dies in the dirt,<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> At the scent of water it will bud / And will produce branches like a <i>new</i> plant.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> But a man dies and is laid low; / Yes, a man expires, and then where is he?<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> The waters of the sea recede, / And the river becomes parched and dried up:<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> So a man lies down and does not rise up; / Until the heavens are no more, he will not awake, / Nor will he be roused from his sleep.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> Oh, that You would hide me in Sheol, / That You would conceal me until Your anger has passed, / That You would set me an appointed time and remember me!<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> If a man dies, will he live <i>again?</i> / All the days of my service I would wait, / Until a change for me should come.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> You would call, and I would answer You; / You would long after the work of Your hands.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> For now You number my steps. / Do You not watch over my sin?<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> My transgression has been sealed up in a bag, / And You have fastened up my iniquity.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> However the mountain falls <i>and</i> crumbles, / And the rock moves from its place;<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> Waters wear away stones; / Their torrents wash away the dust of the earth: / So You destroy the hope of man.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> You prevail forever against him, and he passes away; / You change his countenance and send him away.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> His sons gain honor, but he does not know <i>it;</i> / And they become insignificant, but he does not perceive it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> Only the pain of his own flesh does he feel, / And his own soul mourns for him.<br><br>
