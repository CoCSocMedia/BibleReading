  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Now on the eighth day Moses called Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel;<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And he said to Aaron, Take for yourself a calf of the herd for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and present <i>them</i> before Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> Then to the children of Israel you shall speak, saying, Take a male goat for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both a year old without blemish, for a burnt offering;<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And an ox and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before Jehovah; and a meal offering mingled with oil; for today Jehovah will appear to you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> So they brought what Moses had commanded before the Tent of Meeting, and all the assembly came near and stood before Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And Moses said, This is what Jehovah has commanded you to do, and the glory of Jehovah shall appear to you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Then Moses said to Aaron, Come near to the altar and offer your sin offering and your burnt offering, and make expiation for yourself and for the people; and make the offering of the people and make expiation for them, just as Jehovah has commanded.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> So Aaron came near to the altar and slaughtered the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> And the sons of Aaron presented the blood to him, and he dipped his finger in the blood and put <i>it</i> on the horns of the altar, and <i>the rest of</i> the blood he poured out at the base of the altar.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> But the fat and the kidneys and the appendage of the liver of the sin offering he burned on the altar, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And the flesh and the skin he burned with fire outside the camp.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> Then he slaughtered the burnt offering; and Aaron’s sons handed the blood to him, and he sprinkled it on and around the altar.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> And they handed the burnt offering to him, piece by piece, and the head, and he burned <i>them</i> on the altar.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> And he washed the inward parts and the legs and burned <i>them</i> upon the burnt offering on the altar.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> Then he presented the people’s offering, and took the goat of the sin offering which was for the people and slaughtered it and offered it for sin, like the first.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And he presented the burnt offering and offered it according to the ordinance.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> Then he presented the meal offering and filled his hand with some of it and burned <i>it</i> on the altar, besides the burnt offering of the morning.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> Then he slaughtered the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings which was for the people; and Aaron’s sons handed the blood to him, which he sprinkled on and around the altar.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> And the fat portions of the ox and of the ram, the fat tail, and <i>the fat</i> which covers <i>the inward parts</i> and the kidneys and the appendage of the liver —<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> These fat portions they then put on the breasts; and he burned the fat portions on the altar.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave offering before Jehovah, just as Moses had commanded.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> And Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them, and he came down from offering the sin offering and the burnt offering and the peace offerings.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> And Moses and Aaron went into the Tent of Meeting. And they came out and blessed the people; and the glory of Jehovah appeared to all the people.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> Then fire came forth from before Jehovah and consumed the burnt offering and the fat portions on the altar. And when all the people saw <i>it,</i> they gave a ringing shout and fell on their faces.<br><br>
