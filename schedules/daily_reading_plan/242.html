  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> There is certainly a mine for silver, / And a place for gold to be refined.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Iron is taken out of the earth, / And copper is smelted from rock.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> <i>The miner</i> sets an end to the darkness, / And to the very end he searches out / The stones of deep darkness and of gloom.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> He breaks open a shaft apart from where <i>men</i> dwell; / They are forgotten by the foot; / They are suspended apart from men, they sway about.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> The earth — from it comes forth food, / Yet underneath it, it is turned up as it were by fire.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> Its stones are the place of sapphires, / And <i>its</i> dust has gold.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> It is a path known by no bird of prey, / And the falcon’s eye has not seen it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> The proud beasts have not trodden it; / The fierce lion does not pass along it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> The miner sends forth his hand into the flinty rock; / He overturns the mountains by <i>its</i> roots.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> He cuts out channels in the rocks, / And his eye sees every precious thing.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> He dams up the streams so that they do not trickle, / And that which is hidden he brings out to the light.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> But where shall wisdom be found? / And where is the place of understanding?<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> Man does not know its price, / Nor is it found in the land of the living.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> The deep says, It is not in me; / And the sea says, It is not with me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> Rare gold cannot be given for it, / Nor can silver be weighed out for its price.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> It cannot be balanced with the gold of Ophir, / With precious onyx or <i>with</i> sapphire.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> Gold and glass cannot compare with it, / Nor can vessels of fine gold be exchanged for it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> Coral and crystal cannot be mentioned <i>with it;</i> / Indeed the acquisition of wisdom is above that of pearls.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> The topaz of Cush cannot compare with it, / Nor can it be balanced with pure gold.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> From where then does wisdom come? / And where is the place of understanding?<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> For it is hidden from the eyes of all living / And concealed from the birds of heaven.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> Abaddon and Death say, / We have heard a report of it with our ears.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> God understands the way to it; / He knows its place.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> For He sees to the ends of the earth; / He beholds all that is under heaven.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> When He gave weight to the wind / And apportioned the water by measure,<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> When He made a decree for the rain / And a way for the thunderbolt;<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> Then He saw it and declared it; / He established it and even searched it out.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> And He said to man, / Indeed, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; / And to depart from evil is understanding.<br><br>
