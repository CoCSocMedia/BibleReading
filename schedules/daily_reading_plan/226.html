  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then Job answered and said,<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Surely then you are the people, / And wisdom will die with you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> I also have understanding as you do; / I am not inferior to you. / And who does not know things like these?<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> I have become a laughingstock to my friends, / I, who have called out to God and He answers me. / The righteous man, the perfect man, is a laughingstock.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> There is contempt for calamity in the thought of him who is at ease: / It is prepared for those whose foot slips.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> The tents of robbers prosper, / And those who provoke God have security, / Those who carry <i>their</i> god in their <i>own</i> might.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> But ask now of the beasts, and they will teach you; / And of the birds of heaven, and they will tell you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> Or speak to the earth, and it will teach you; / And the fish of the sea will declare to you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> Who among all these does not know / That the hand of Jehovah has done this,<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> In whose hand is the life of every living thing / And the breath of all flesh of man?<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> Does not the ear try words / Even as the palate tastes food for itself?<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> In aged men, <i>you say,</i> there is wisdom, / And in length of days there is understanding.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> <i>But</i> with Him are wisdom and might; / Counsel and understanding are His.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> Indeed, He breaks down, and it cannot be rebuilt; / He shuts a man up, and <i>the door</i> cannot be opened.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> Indeed, He withholds the waters, and they dry up; / And He sends them forth, and they overturn the earth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> With Him are strength and effectual wisdom; / The deceived and the deceiver are His.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> He leads counselors away stripped, / And He makes fools of judges.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> He loosens the fetters of kings / And binds their loins with a belt.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> He leads priests away stripped, / And He overturns dignitaries.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> He removes the utterance of the trusty / And takes away the counsel of the elders.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> He pours contempt upon the princes / And loosens the belt of the strong.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> He uncovers the depths out of darkness / And brings to light the shadow of death.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> He makes nations great and destroys them; / He expands nations and leads them off.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> He removes the understanding of the heads of the people of the earth / And causes them to wander in a pathless waste.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> They grope in darkness, and there is no light; / And He causes them to stagger like a drunken man.<br><br>
