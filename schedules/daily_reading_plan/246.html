  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then these three men ceased answering Job, for he was righteous in his own eyes.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And the anger of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, was kindled. Against Job was his anger kindled because he justified himself rather than God;<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And against his three friends was his anger kindled because they had found no answer but had condemned Job.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Now Elihu had waited to speak with Job, because they were older than he.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> But when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of the three men, his anger was kindled.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> So Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said,I am young, / And you are aged; / Therefore I shrank back and was afraid / To declare to you what I know.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> I said, Let age speak, / And let the multitude of years make wisdom known.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> But there is a spirit in man, / And the breath of the Almighty gives them understanding.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> It is not the great who are wise, / Nor the old who understand justice.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> Therefore I say, Hear me; / I also will declare what I know.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> Indeed, I have waited out your words; / I have given ear to your reasonings, / While you searched for what to say.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> Indeed I gave you my full attention; / But no one here could refute Job; / None of you answered his words.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> Do not say, We have found wisdom; / God will defeat him, not man.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> But he did not arrange <i>his</i> words against me; / Neither will I respond to him with your speeches.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> They are dismayed; they answer no more; / Words fail them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> Then should I wait? For they do not speak, / For they stand still; they answer no more.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> I also will answer what has been apportioned to me; / I also will declare what I know.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> For I am full of words; / The spirit in my inward parts constrains me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> Indeed, my inward parts are like wine that is not vented; / Like new wineskins, they are about to burst.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> Let me speak, that there may be relief for me; / Let me open my lips and answer.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> Let me not, I beg you, respect any man’s person, / Nor flatter any man;<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> For I do not know how to flatter — / My Maker would soon bear me off.<br><br>
