  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And as David dwelt in his house, David said to Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah dwells under curtains.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And Nathan said to David, All that is in your heart do, for God is with you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And in that night the word of God came to Nathan, saying,<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Go and say to David My servant, Thus says Jehovah, It will not be you who builds Me a house to dwell in.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> For I have not dwelt in a house, since the day I brought up Israel to this day; but I have been from tent to tent and from tabernacle <i>to tabernacle.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> In all My going about among all Israel, did I ever speak a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd My people, saying, Why have you not built Me a house of cedar?<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And now thus shall you say to My servant David, Thus says Jehovah of hosts, I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, that you might be ruler over My people Israel;<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And I have been with you in every place that you have gone and have cut off all your enemies before you; and I will make a name for you, like the name of the great ones who are on the earth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> And I will appoint a place for My people Israel and will plant them <i>there,</i> that they may dwell in their own place and be disturbed no more; and the sons of wickedness will waste <i>them</i> away no more as before,<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> Even since the time when I commanded <i>that there be</i> judges over My people Israel; and I will subdue all your enemies. Moreover I declare to you that Jehovah will build you a house.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> When your days are fulfilled that you must go <i>to be</i> with your fathers, I will raise up your seed after you, which will be from your sons, and I will establish his kingdom.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> It is he who will build a house for Me, and I will establish his throne forever.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> I will be his Father, and he will be My son; and My lovingkindness I will not take from him, as I took <i>it</i> away from <i>him</i> who was before you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> And I will set him in My house and My kingdom forever, and his throne will be established forever.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> According to all these words and according to this whole vision did Nathan speak to David.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> Then King David went and sat before Jehovah; and he said, Who am I, O Jehovah God, and what is my house that You have brought me this far?<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> And this was a small thing in Your sight, O God; but You have spoken of the house of Your servant for a great while to come; and You have regarded me according to the custom for a man of high degree, O Jehovah God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> What more can David add <i>to say</i> to You concerning <i>this</i> honoring of Your servant? For You know Your servant.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> O Jehovah, for Your servant’s sake and according to Your own heart, You have done all this greatness to make known all <i>these</i> great things.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> O Jehovah, there is none like You, nor is there any God besides You, according to all that we have heard with our ears.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And who is like Your people Israel, a nation unique on the earth, which God went to redeem to Himself as a people in order to make for Yourself a name of greatness and awesomeness to drive out nations from before Your people, whom You have redeemed out of Egypt?<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> And You have made Your people Israel to be a people to You forever, and You, O Jehovah, became their God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> And now, O Jehovah, may the word which You have spoken concerning Your servant and concerning his house be established forever, and do as You have spoken.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> And may Your name be established and magnified forever when <i>men</i> say, Jehovah of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel; and the house of David Your servant will be established before You.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> For You, O my God, have revealed to Your servant, that You will build him a house; therefore Your servant has found <i>it in his heart</i> to pray before You.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> And now, O Jehovah, You are God, and You have spoken this good matter concerning Your servant;<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> Now therefore You have been pleased to bless the house of Your servant, that it may be before You forever; for You, O Jehovah, have blessed, and it is blessed forever.<br><br>
