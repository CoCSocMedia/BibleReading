     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And over the division of the second month was Dodai the Ahohite and his division, with Mikloth being the leader; and in his division were twenty-four thousand.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> The third captain of the army for the third month was Benaiah the chief, the son of Jehoiada the priest; and in his division were twenty-four thousand.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> This is that Benaiah who was the mighty man of the thirty and <i>who was</i> over the thirty; and <i>in</i> his division was Ammizabad his son.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> The fourth for the fourth month was Asahel the brother of Joab and Zebadiah his son after him; and in his division were twenty-four thousand.<br><br>

     <sup><b>24</b></sup> Joab the son of Zeruiah had begun to number <i>them</i> but did not finish; and because of this, wrath came upon Israel. Nor was the number put into the account in the chronicles of King David.<br><br>

     <sup><b>31</b></sup> All these were the overseers of the property that belonged to King David.<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> In addition, Jonathan, David’s uncle, was a counselor, a man of understanding, and a scribe; and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was with the king’s sons;<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> And Ahithophel was the king’s counselor; and Hushai the Archite was the king’s friend;<br><br>
     <sup><b>34</b></sup> And after Ahithophel was Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, then Abiathar; and the captain of the king’s army was Joab.<br><br>
