  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> O Jehovah, You have searched me and known <i>me.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> You know when I sit down and when I rise up; / You understand my thoughts from afar.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> You thoroughly search my path and my lying down, / And You are acquainted with all my ways.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> For a word is not <i>yet</i> on my tongue, / <i>And</i> already You, O Jehovah, know it completely.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> You have closed in on me behind and before / And have laid Your hand on me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> Oh, knowledge too wonderful for me! / It is so high; I cannot attain to it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Where shall I go, away from Your Spirit, / And where shall I flee from Your presence?<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> If I ascend into heaven, You are there; / If I make my bed in Sheol, there You are.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> If I take the wings of the dawn / <i>And</i> settle at the limits of the sea,<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> There also Your hand will lead me, / And Your right hand will take hold of me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And if I say, Surely darkness will cover me, / And the light around me will be night;<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> Even the darkness is not dark to You, / And night shines like day; / The darkness is like the light.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> For it was You who formed my inward parts; / You wove me together in my mother’s womb.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> I will praise You, for I am awesomely and wonderfully made; / Your works are wonderful, / And my soul knows <i>it</i> well.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> My frame was not hidden from You / When I was made in secret, / Skillfully fashioned in the depths of the earth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> Your eyes saw my unformed substance; / And in Your book all of them were written: / The days that were ordained <i>for me,</i> / When not one of them was yet.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> And how precious are Your thoughts to me, O God! / How great is the sum of them!<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> If I should count them, they would be more than the sand. / When I awake, I am still with You.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> Oh that You, O God, would slay the wicked — / Depart from me therefore, you men of bloodshed —<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> Those who speak of You with evil intent, / Who as Your enemies take <i>Your name</i> in vain.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> Do I not hate those who hate You, O Jehovah? / And do I not loathe those who rise up against You?<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> I hate them with a perfect hatred; / They have become my own enemies.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> Search me, O God, and know my heart; / Try me, and know my anxious thoughts;<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> And see if there is some harmful way in me, / And lead me on the eternal way.<br><br>
