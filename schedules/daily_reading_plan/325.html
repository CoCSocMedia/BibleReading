  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Save me, O God; for the waters / Threaten my life.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> I sink in deep mire, / And there is no place to stand; / I have come to the depths of water, / And the flood flows over me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> I am weary of my crying; / My throat is parched; / My eyes fail / While I wait for my God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> More numerous than the hairs of my head / Are those who hate me without cause; / Mighty are those who would destroy me, / Those who are wrongly my enemies. / What I did not steal, / I must then restore.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> O God, You know my foolishness, / And my sins of guilt are not hidden from You.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> Do not let those who wait on You be put to shame because of me, / O Lord Jehovah of hosts; / Do not let those who seek You be humiliated because of me, / O God of Israel.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Because for Your sake I have borne reproach; / Humiliation has covered my face.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> I have become a stranger to my brothers, / And a foreigner to my mother’s children.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> For the zeal of Your house has devoured me, / And the reproaches of those who reproach You have fallen on me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> When I wept, <i>when</i> my soul was in fasting, / <i>That</i> became a reproach to me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> When I made sackcloth my clothing, / I became a proverb to them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> Those who sit in the gate talk about me, / And <i>I am</i> the <i>mocking</i> song of those who drink liquor.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> But as for me, my prayer is to You, / O Jehovah, in an acceptable time; / O God, in the abundance of Your lovingkindness answer me, / In the faithfulness of Your salvation.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink; / May I be delivered from those who hate me, / And out of the depths of water.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> Do not let the flood of water flow over me, / Nor let the deep swallow me, / Nor let the pit close its mouth over me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> Answer me, O Jehovah; for Your lovingkindness is good; / According to the abundance of Your compassions turn to me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> And do not hide Your face from Your servant, / For I am in distress; hurry <i>and</i> answer me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> Draw near to my soul; redeem it; / Ransom me because of my enemies.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> You know my reproach / And my shame and my humiliation; / All my adversaries are before You.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> Reproach has broken my heart, / And I am sick; / I looked for pity, but there was none; / And for comforters, but I found none.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> But they gave me gall for my food, / And for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> May their table become a snare before them / And a trap <i>when they are</i> at peace.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> May their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see; / And make their loins shake continually.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> Pour out Your indignation upon them; / And may the burning fierceness of Your anger overtake them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> May their camp be desolate; / May there be no one to dwell in their tents.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> For they persecute him whom You have stricken, / And they recount the pain of those whom You have wounded.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> Add iniquity to their iniquity, / And do not let them come into Your righteousness.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> May they be blotted out of the book of life, / And may they not be written with the righteous.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> But I am poor and pained; / May Your salvation, O God, set me on high.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> I will praise the name of God with a song / And will magnify Him with thanksgiving;<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> And it will be better to Jehovah than an ox / <i>Or</i> a bull with horns and hooves.<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> The meek have seen <i>it;</i> they rejoice. / You who seek God, let your heart revive.<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> For Jehovah listens to the needy, / And He does not despise His prisoners.<br><br>
     <sup><b>34</b></sup> Let the heavens and the earth praise Him, / The seas and everything that moves in them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>35</b></sup> For God will save Zion / And build the cities of Judah; / And they will abide there and possess it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>36</b></sup> And the seed of His servants will inherit it, / And those who love His name will dwell in it.<br><br>
