  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And Elihu added <i>this</i> and said,<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Bear with me a little, and I will show you; / For there is more to say for God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> I will bring my knowledge from afar / And will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> For truly my words are not false; / One perfect in knowledge is with you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> Indeed, God is mighty and does not despise; / <i>He is</i> mighty in strength of understanding.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> He does not preserve the wicked man alive, / But gives justice to the afflicted.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> He does not withdraw His eyes from the righteous; / And with kings on the throne, / He sets them forever, and they are exalted.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And if they are bound in fetters, / If they are caught in the cords of affliction,<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> He shows them their work / And their transgressions, that they have acted arrogantly.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> He also opens their ear to instruction / And commands that they return from iniquity.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> If they hear and serve <i>Him,</i> / They will spend their days in prosperity / And their years in pleasantness.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> But if they do not hear, they will pass away by the sword / And die without knowledge.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> But those who are profane in heart lay up anger; / They do not cry for help when He binds them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> They die in youth, / And their life <i>ends</i> among the most defiled.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> He rescues the afflicted by their affliction / And opens their ear through oppression.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> Indeed He allures you from the jaws of distress / Into a spacious place, where there is no constraint; / And what is upon your table is full of fatness.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> But you are filled with the judgment of the wicked; / Judgment and litigation have taken hold <i>of you.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> <i>Beware</i> lest wrath allures you into scoffing, / And do not let the greatness of the ransom turn you aside.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> Will your cry keep <i>you</i> from being in distress, / Or all the forces of <i>your</i> strength?<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> Do not long for the night, / When people are taken from their place.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> Take heed; do not turn toward iniquity; / For you have chosen this rather than affliction.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> Indeed, God is exalted in His power: / Who is a teacher like Him?<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> Who has appointed His way for Him? / And who says, You have done wrong?<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> Remember to magnify His work, / Of which men sing.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> All mankind has gazed on it; / Man beholds <i>it</i> from afar.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> Indeed, God is great, and we do not know <i>Him;</i> / The number of His years we also cannot search out.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> For He draws up the drops of water / Which distill into rain from His mist,<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> Which the skies pour down / <i>And</i> drop upon man abundantly.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> Can they indeed understand the spreading of the clouds, / The thunderings of His pavilion?<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> Indeed, He scatters His lightning around Him / And covers the roots of the sea.<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> For by these He judges the peoples; / He gives food in abundance.<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> He fills <i>His</i> hands with lightning / And commands it to strike the mark.<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> Its noise tells of Him; / The cattle as well <i>tell</i> concerning Him who is coming.<br><br>
