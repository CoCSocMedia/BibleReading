  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Strive, O Jehovah, with those who strive with me; / Battle against those who battle against me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Take hold of buckler and shield, / And rise up as my help.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> Draw out also the spear, and close up <i>the way</i> / Against those who pursue me; / Say to my soul, / I am your salvation.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Let those who seek my life / Be put to shame and humiliated; / Let those who devise evil for me / Be turned back and confounded.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> Let them be like chaff before the wind, / With the angel of Jehovah driving <i>them</i> on.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> Let their way be darkness and slipperiness itself, / With the angel of Jehovah pursuing them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> For without cause they hid their net for me; / Without cause they dug a pit for me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> Let destruction come upon him unawares, / And let his net, which he hid, catch him; / Let him fall into it, into destruction.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> Then my soul will exult in Jehovah; / It will rejoice in His salvation.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> All my bones will say, / Jehovah, who is like You, / Who delivers the poor from him who is too strong for him, / And the poor and needy from him who robs him?<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> Malicious witnesses rise up; / They ask me about things I know nothing of.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> They repay me evil for good; / I am bereaved in soul.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> But I, when they were sick, / <i>Had</i> sackcloth as my clothing; / I afflicted my soul with fasting, / And my prayer returned to my own bosom.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> I conducted myself as if it had been my friend or my brother; / Like one mourning for <i>his</i> mother, I bowed down gloomily.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> But at my stumbling they rejoice and gather together; / The attackers, whom I did not know / Gather together against me; / They tear <i>at me</i> and do not cease.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> As profane mocking parasites, / They gnash their teeth at me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> O Lord, how long will You look on? / Rescue my soul from their destruction, / My precious life from the lions.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> I will give You thanks in the great congregation; / Among a mighty people I will praise You.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> Do not let those who are wrongly my enemies rejoice over me; / Do not let those who hate me without cause narrow their eyes <i>at me.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> For they do not speak peace, / But devise words of deceit / Against the quiet people of the land.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And they open their mouth wide against me; / They say, Aha! Aha! Our eyes have seen <i>it.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> You have seen, O Jehovah; do not be silent. / O Lord, do not be far from me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> Awake, and stir Yourself for my cause, / For my claim, O my God and my Lord.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> Vindicate me according to Your righteousness, O Jehovah my God; / And do not let them rejoice over me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> Do not let them say in their heart, / Aha! That is what we wanted. / Do not let them say, We have swallowed him up.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> May those who rejoice at my trouble / Be ashamed and confounded together; / May those who magnify themselves against me / Be clothed with shame and humiliation.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> May those who delight <i>in the vindication of</i> my righteousness / Give a ringing shout and rejoice, / And may they say continually, / Jehovah be magnified, / Who delights in the well-being of His servant.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> And my tongue will declare Your righteousness / <i>And</i> Your praise all day long.<br><br>
