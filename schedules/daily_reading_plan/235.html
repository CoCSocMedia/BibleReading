  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then Job answered and said,<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Listen carefully to my word, / And let this be your consolations.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> Bear with me, and I will speak; / And after I have spoken, mock on.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> As for me, is my complaint to man? / And why should my spirit not be impatient?<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> Look at me and be appalled; / And put <i>your</i> hand over <i>your</i> mouth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> Even when I remember, I am troubled, / And horror takes hold of my flesh.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Why do the wicked live, / Grow old, even become mighty in riches?<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> Their seed is established with them in their sight, / And their offspring, before their eyes.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> Their houses are free from dread, / And the rod of God is not upon them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> Their bull breeds and does not fail; / Their cow calves and does not miscarry.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> They send forth their little ones like a herd, / And their children dance.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> They lift up <i>their voices</i> to the tambourine and lyre, / And they rejoice at the sound of the flute.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> They spend their days in prosperity, / And in a moment they go down into Sheol.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> And they say unto God, Depart from us, / For we do not desire the knowledge of Your ways.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> What is the Almighty, that we should serve Him? / And what profit is there, that we should pray to Him?<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> Indeed, their prosperity is not in their own hand. / The counsel of the wicked is far from Him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> How often is the lamp of the wicked put out, / So that their calamity comes upon them, / So that God distributes sorrows in His anger?<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> Do they become like straw before the wind / And like chaff that the storm carries off?<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> <i>You say,</i> God stores up <i>the punishment of</i> his iniquity for his children. / <i>I say,</i> Let Him recompense him, so that he knows <i>it.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> Let his eyes see his destruction, / And let him drink the wrath of the Almighty.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> For what is there for him to delight in, in his house after him, / When the number of his months is cut off?<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> Will someone teach knowledge to God, / Seeing that He judges those who are on high?<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> One dies in his full strength, / Being completely at ease and quiet;<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> His pails are full of milk, / And the marrow of his bones is moist.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> But another dies in bitterness of soul / And does not taste of good.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> They lie down alike in the dust, / And the worm covers them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> Indeed, I know your thoughts, / And the devices by which you would wrong me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> For you say, Where is the house of the prince? / Where is the tent of the dwellings of the wicked?<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> Have you not asked those who travel the roads? / And do you not regard their evidence,<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> That the wicked man is spared in the day of calamity, / <i>That</i> they are led forth at the day of overflowing wrath?<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> Who will declare his way to his face? / And who will repay him what he has done?<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> When he is borne to the grave, / A watch is kept over the tomb.<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> The clods of the valley are sweet to him; / And all men go in procession after him, / And <i>those who went</i> before him are without number.<br><br>
     <sup><b>34</b></sup> Why then do you comfort me with vanity? / For your responses leave <i>only</i> falsehood behind.<br><br>
