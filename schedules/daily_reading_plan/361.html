  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Give thanks to Jehovah; call upon His name; / Make known His deeds among the peoples.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Sing to Him; sing psalms to Him; / Muse upon all His wondrous deeds.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> Glory in His holy name; / Let the heart of those who seek Jehovah rejoice.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Seek Jehovah and His strength; / Seek His face continually.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> Remember His wondrous deeds, which He has done, / His signs and the judgments of His mouth,<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> O seed of Abraham His servant, / O children of Jacob, His chosen ones.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> He is Jehovah our God; / His judgments are in all the earth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> He has remembered His covenant forever, / The word that He commanded to a thousand generations,<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> <i>The covenant</i> that He made with Abraham, / And His oath unto Isaac.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And He confirmed it unto Jacob as a statute, / Unto Israel <i>as</i> an eternal covenant,<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> Saying, To you I will give the land of Canaan, / The portion of your inheritance;<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> When they were men few in number, / Indeed very few and strangers in the land.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> And they went about from nation to nation, / From <i>one</i> kingdom to another people.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> He allowed no man to oppress them; / Indeed He rebuked kings for their sake.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> <i>Saying,</i> Do not touch My anointed ones, / And do My prophets no harm.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And He called a famine upon the land; / He broke the whole staff of bread.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> He sent a man before them; / Joseph was sold as a servant.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> They afflicted his feet with fetters; / He himself was placed in irons.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> Until the time when his word came to pass, / The word of Jehovah tried him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> The king sent <i>men</i> and freed him, / Even the ruler of the peoples, and let him go.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> He made him lord of his house / And ruler over all his possessions,<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> To imprison his princes at will, / And to teach his elders wisdom.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> Then Israel came into Egypt, / And Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> And He made His people very fruitful, / And caused them to be mightier than their adversaries.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> He turned their heart to hate His people, / To deal craftily with His servants.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> He sent Moses His servant, / <i>And</i> Aaron, whom He had chosen.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> They set His signs among them, / And wonders in the land of Ham.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> He sent darkness and made it dark; / And they did not rebel against His words.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> He turned their waters into blood, / And killed their fish.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> Their land teemed with frogs, / <i>Even</i> in the chambers of their kings.<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> He spoke, and a swarm of flies came; / <i>There were</i> lice within all their borders.<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> He gave them hail for rain, / <i>And</i> flaming fire in their land.<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> He struck their vines and their fig trees, / And He broke the trees of their borders.<br><br>
     <sup><b>34</b></sup> He spoke, and the swarming locusts came, / And the licking locusts, even without number.<br><br>
     <sup><b>35</b></sup> And they ate every herb in their land, / And they ate the fruit of their ground.<br><br>
     <sup><b>36</b></sup> He struck all the firstborn in their land, / The firstfruits of all their vigor.<br><br>
     <sup><b>37</b></sup> And He brought them out with silver and gold, / And there was none among His tribes who stumbled.<br><br>
     <sup><b>38</b></sup> Egypt rejoiced at their going forth, / For a dread of them had fallen upon them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>39</b></sup> He spread a cloud for a covering, / And a fire to give light by night.<br><br>
     <sup><b>40</b></sup> They asked, and He brought quails; / And He satisfied them with the bread of heaven.<br><br>
     <sup><b>41</b></sup> He opened the rock, and water gushed forth; / It ran in the dry places <i>like</i> a river.<br><br>
     <sup><b>42</b></sup> For He remembered His holy word / <i>And</i> Abraham His servant.<br><br>
     <sup><b>43</b></sup> And He brought forth His people with gladness, / His chosen ones with a ringing shout.<br><br>
     <sup><b>44</b></sup> And He gave them the lands of the nations, / And they took possession of the labor of the peoples,<br><br>
     <sup><b>45</b></sup> So that they might keep His statutes / And observe His laws. / Hallelujah.<br><br>
