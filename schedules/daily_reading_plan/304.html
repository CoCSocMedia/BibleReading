  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which is called the Passover, was drawing near.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking a way to do away with Him, for they feared the people.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And Satan entered into Judas who was called Iscariot and was of the number of the twelve.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And he went away and conferred with the chief priests and officers as to how he might deliver Him up to them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And they rejoiced and promised to give him money.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And he consented and sought opportunity to deliver Him up to them apart from the crowd.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And the day of Unleavened Bread came, on which the passover had to be sacrificed.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And He sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare the passover for us, so that we may eat it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> And they said to Him, Where do You want us to prepare it?<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And He told them, Behold, as you are entering into the city, a man carrying an earthen jar of water will meet you. Follow him into the house which he enters.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And you shall say to the master of the house, The Teacher says to you, Where is the guest room where I may eat the passover with My disciples?<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And that one will show you a large upper room furnished; prepare there.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> And they left and found it even as He had told them, and they prepared the passover.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> And when the hour came, He reclined at table, and the apostles with Him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And He said to them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer,<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> For I tell you that I shall by no means eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> And He received a cup and gave thanks and said, Take this and divide it among yourselves;<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> For I tell you, I shall by no means drink from now on of the product of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> And He took a loaf and gave thanks, and He broke it and gave it to them, saying, This is My body which is being given for you; do this in remembrance of Me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> And similarly the cup after they had dined, saying, This cup is the new covenant established in My blood, which is being poured out for you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> But behold, the hand of the one betraying Me is with Me at the table.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> For the Son of Man is going according to what has been determined, but woe to that man through whom He is betrayed!<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> And they began to discuss among themselves who then of them it was who was about to do this.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> And a contention also occurred among them as to which of them seemed to be greatest.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> And He said to them, The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those who have authority over them are called benefactors.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> But you shall not be so; but let the greatest among you become like the youngest, and the one who leads like the one who serves.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> For who is greater, the one who reclines at table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines at table? But I am in your midst as the one who serves.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> But you are those who have remained with Me throughout My trials.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> And I appoint to you, even as My Father has appointed to Me, a kingdom,<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> That you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom; and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has asked to have you all to sift you as wheat.<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> But I have made petition concerning you that your faith would not fail; and you, once you have turned again, establish your brothers.<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> And he said to Him, Lord, I am ready to go with You both to prison and to death.<br><br>
     <sup><b>34</b></sup> But He said, I tell you, Peter, a rooster will not crow today until you deny three times that you know Me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>35</b></sup> And He said to them, When I sent you without purse and bag and sandals, you did not lack anything, did you? And they said, Nothing.<br><br>
     <sup><b>36</b></sup> And He said to them, But now, let him who has a purse take it, likewise also a bag; and he who has no sword, let him sell his garment and buy one.<br><br>
     <sup><b>37</b></sup> For I tell you that this which is written must be accomplished in Me, “And He was counted with the lawless.” For indeed that which concerns Me has its fulfillment.<br><br>
     <sup><b>38</b></sup> And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And He said to them, It is enough.<br><br>
     <sup><b>39</b></sup> And He came out and went according to His custom to the Mount of Olives; and the disciples also followed Him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>40</b></sup> And when He came to the place, He said to them, Pray that you do not enter into temptation.<br><br>
     <sup><b>41</b></sup> And He withdrew from them about a stone’s throw, and He knelt down and prayed,<br><br>
     <sup><b>42</b></sup> Saying, Father, if You are willing, remove this cup from Me; yet, not My will, but Yours be done.<br><br>
     <sup><b>43</b></sup> And an angel from heaven appeared to Him, strengthening Him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>44</b></sup> And being in agony He prayed more earnestly, and His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down upon the ground.<br><br>
     <sup><b>45</b></sup> And when He rose up from prayer and came to the disciples, He found them sleeping from sorrow,<br><br>
     <sup><b>46</b></sup> And He said to them, Why are you sleeping? Rise up and pray that you may not enter into temptation.<br><br>
     <sup><b>47</b></sup> While He was still speaking, behold, a crowd came, and he who is called Judas, one of the twelve, was going before them and drew near to Jesus to kiss Him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>48</b></sup> But Jesus said to him, Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?<br><br>
     <sup><b>49</b></sup> And those around Him, seeing what would happen, said, Lord, shall we strike with the sword?<br><br>
     <sup><b>50</b></sup> And a certain one of them struck the slave of the high priest and took off his right ear.<br><br>
     <sup><b>51</b></sup> But Jesus answered and said, Let them go this far. And touching his ear, He healed him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>52</b></sup> And Jesus said to the chief priests and officers of the temple and elders who had come up against Him, Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs?<br><br>
     <sup><b>53</b></sup> While I was with you day by day in the temple, you did not stretch out your hands against Me. But this is your hour and the authority of darkness.<br><br>
     <sup><b>54</b></sup> And having arrested Him, they led Him away, and brought Him into the house of the high priest.        But Peter followed at a distance.<br><br>
     <sup><b>55</b></sup> And when they had lit a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat among them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>56</b></sup> And a certain servant girl, seeing him seated in the light of the fire, looked intently at him and said, This man was with Him too.<br><br>
     <sup><b>57</b></sup> But he denied it, saying, I do not know Him, woman.<br><br>
     <sup><b>58</b></sup> And after a short time, another person, seeing him, said, You also are one of them. But Peter said, Man, I am not!<br><br>
     <sup><b>59</b></sup> And after about one hour had passed, another one insisted, saying, Surely this man was also with Him, for he is also a Galilean.<br><br>
     <sup><b>60</b></sup> But Peter said, Man, I do not know what you are saying. And instantly, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.<br><br>
     <sup><b>61</b></sup> And the Lord turned and looked at Peter, and Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had said to him, Before a rooster crows today, you will deny Me three times.<br><br>
     <sup><b>62</b></sup> And he went outside and wept bitterly.<br><br>
     <sup><b>63</b></sup> And the men who were holding Him mocked Him and beat Him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>64</b></sup> And they blindfolded Him and questioned Him, saying, Prophesy! Who is the one who hit You?<br><br>
     <sup><b>65</b></sup> And they said many other things against Him, blaspheming.<br><br>
     <sup><b>66</b></sup> And when it became day, the assembly of the elders of the people, both chief priests and scribes, were gathered together, and they led Him away to their Sanhedrin, saying,<br><br>
     <sup><b>67</b></sup> If You are the Christ, tell us. But He said to them, If I tell you, you shall by no means believe;<br><br>
     <sup><b>68</b></sup> And if I ask you, you shall by no means answer.<br><br>
     <sup><b>69</b></sup> But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>70</b></sup> And they all said, Are You then the Son of God? And He said to them, You say rightly that I am.<br><br>
     <sup><b>71</b></sup> And they said, What further need do we have of testimony? For we have heard it ourselves from His mouth. <br><br>
