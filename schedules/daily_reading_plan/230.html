  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And Bezalel made the Ark of acacia wood: two and a half cubits was its length; and one and a half cubits, its width; and one and a half cubits, its height.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And he overlaid it with pure gold inside and outside, and made a rim of gold around it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And he cast four rings of gold for it, on its four feet; and two rings were on the one side of it, and two rings on the other side of it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And he made poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And he put the poles into the rings on the sides of the Ark to carry the Ark.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And he made an expiation cover of pure gold: two and a half cubits was its length, and one and a half cubits, its width.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And he made two cherubim of gold; of beaten work he made them, at the two ends of the expiation cover,<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> One cherub at the one end and one cherub at the other end; of <i>one piece with</i> the expiation cover he made the cherubim at its two ends.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> And the cherubim spread out their wings above <i>the cover,</i> covering the expiation cover with their wings, with their faces toward one another; the faces of the cherubim were toward the expiation cover.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And he made the table of acacia wood: two cubits was its length, and a cubit its width, and one and a half cubits its height.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And he overlaid it with pure gold and made a rim of gold around it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And he made a frame of a handbreadth around it, and he made a rim of gold for its frame around <i>it.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> And he cast for it four rings of gold and put the rings on the four corners that were on its four feet.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> The rings were close to the frame <i>as</i> holders for the poles to carry the table.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And he made the poles of acacia wood to carry the table and overlaid them with gold.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And he made the utensils which were <i>to be</i> upon the table: its plates and its cups and its bowls and its pitchers with which to pour out <i>drink offerings,</i> of pure gold.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> And he made the lampstand of pure gold. He made the lampstand <i>with</i> its base and its shaft of beaten work; its cups, its calyxes, and its blossom buds were of one piece with it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> And there were six branches going out of its sides; three branches of the lampstand out of one of its sides, and three branches of the lampstand out of its other side;<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> Three cups made like almond <i>blossoms</i> in one branch, a calyx and a blossom bud; and three cups made like almond <i>blossoms</i> in the other branch, a calyx and a blossom bud — so for the six branches going out of the lampstand.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> And on the lampstand were four cups made like almond <i>blossoms,</i> its calyxes and its blossom buds;<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And a calyx under two branches of <i>one piece with</i> it, and a calyx under two branches of <i>one piece with</i> it, and a calyx under two branches of <i>one piece with</i> it, for the six branches going out of it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> Their calyxes and their branches were of <i>one piece with</i> it; all of it was one beaten work of pure gold.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> And he made its seven lamps and its tongs and its firepans, of pure gold.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> He made it of a talent of pure gold, and all its utensils.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> And he made the altar of incense of acacia wood; a cubit was its length, and a cubit, its width, square; and two cubits, its height; its horns were of <i>one piece with</i> it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> And he overlaid it with pure gold, its top and its sides around <i>it</i> and its horns; and he made a rim of gold around <i>it.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> And he made for it two golden rings under its rim, on its two sides, on its opposite sides, as holders for poles with which to carry it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> And he made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> And he made the holy anointing oil and the pure fragrant incense, the work of a compounder.<br><br>
