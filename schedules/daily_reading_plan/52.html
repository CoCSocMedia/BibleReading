  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And as the king dwelt in his house and Jehovah gave him rest all around from all his enemies,<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> The king said to Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the Ark of God dwells within curtains.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And Nathan said to the king, All that is in your heart go <i>and</i> do, for Jehovah is with you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And in that night the word of Jehovah came to Nathan, saying,<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> Go and say to My servant David, Thus says Jehovah, Is it you who will build Me a house for Me to dwell in?<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> For I have not dwelt in a house, since the day I brought the children of Israel up out of Egypt to this day; but I went about in a tent and in a tabernacle.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> In all My going about among all the children of Israel, did I ever speak a word to any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd My people Israel, saying, Why have you not built Me a house of cedar?<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And now thus shall you say to My servant David, Thus says Jehovah of hosts, I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, that you might be ruler over My people, over Israel;<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> And I have been with you in every place that you have gone and have cut off all your enemies before you; and I will make a great name for you, like the name of the great ones who are on the earth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And I will appoint a place for My people Israel and will plant them <i>there,</i> that they may dwell in their own place and be disturbed no more; and the sons of wickedness will ill-treat them no more as before,<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> Even since the time when I commanded <i>that there be</i> judges over My people Israel; and I will give you rest from all your enemies. Moreover Jehovah declares to you that Jehovah will make you a house.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> When your days are fulfilled and you sleep with your fathers, I will raise up your seed after you, which will come forth from your body, and I will establish his kingdom.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> It is he who will build a house for My name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> I will be his Father, and he will be My son. If he commits iniquity, I will strike him with the rod of men and with the stripes of the sons of men;<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> But My lovingkindness will not depart from him, as I took <i>it</i> away from Saul, whom I put away before you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And your house and your kingdom will be made sure forever before you; your throne will be established forever.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> According to all these words and according to this whole vision did Nathan speak to David.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> Then King David went and sat before Jehovah; and he said, Who am I, O Lord Jehovah, and what is my house that You have brought me this far?<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> And this was yet a small thing in Your sight, O Lord Jehovah; but You have spoken also of the house of Your servant for a great while to come; and is this the custom for man, O Lord Jehovah?<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> And what more can David say to You? For You know Your servant, O Lord Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> For Your word’s sake and according to Your own heart, You have done all this greatness to make Your servant know <i>it.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> Therefore You are great, O Lord Jehovah; for there is none like You, nor is there any God besides You, according to all that we have heard with our ears.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> And who is like Your people Israel, a nation unique on the earth, whom God went to redeem to Himself as a people in order to make a name for Himself and to do for You what is great and awesome for Your land <i>and</i> before Your people, whom You have redeemed to Yourself out of Egypt, <i>from</i> the nations and their gods?<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> And You have established Your people Israel to be a people to You forever, and You, O Jehovah, became their God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> And now, O Jehovah God, confirm forever the word which You have spoken concerning Your servant and concerning his house, and do as You have spoken.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> And may Your name be magnified forever when <i>men</i> say, Jehovah of hosts is God over Israel; and the house of Your servant David will be established before You.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> For You, O Jehovah of hosts, God of Israel, have revealed to Your servant, saying, I will build you a house; therefore Your servant has found <i>it</i> in his heart to pray this prayer to You.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> And now, O Lord Jehovah, You are God, and Your words are true, and You have spoken this good matter to Your servant;<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> Now therefore may it please You to bless the house of Your servant, that it may be before You forever; for You, O Lord Jehovah, have spoken <i>it.</i> And with Your blessing may the house of Your servant be blessed forever.<br><br>
