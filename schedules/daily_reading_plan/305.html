  <h4 id="psalms-49"><a onclick="open_chapter('top', '19-psalms.html')">Psalms 49</a></h4>
  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Hear this, all you peoples; / Give ear, all you inhabitants of the world,<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Both low and high, / Rich and poor together;<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> My mouth will speak wisdom, / And the meditation of my heart will be that of understanding.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> I will incline my ear to a parable; / I will disclose my riddle upon the harp.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> Why should I fear in the days of evil, / When the iniquity of those who supplant me surrounds me,<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> Those who trust in their wealth / And boast in the multitude of their riches?<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> None can by any means redeem <i>his</i> brother / Or give to God a ransom for him<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> (For the redemption of their soul is costly / And must be given up forever),<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> That he would yet live always / <i>And</i> not see corruption.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> For he will see <i>that</i> wise men die; / The foolish one and the senseless one perish alike / And leave their wealth to others.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> Their inward thought is that their houses <i>will remain</i> forever, / That their habitations <i>will remain</i> from generation to generation; / They call lands after their own names.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> But man in honor does not remain; / He is like the beasts that perish.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> Such is the way of those who are self-confident, / And of those after them who approve of their sayings. Selah<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> Like a flock, they are appointed for Sheol; / Death will shepherd them. / And straight to the grave they will descend, / And their form will be for Sheol to consume / That there be no abode for them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> But God will redeem my soul / From the power of Sheol, / For He will receive me. Selah<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> Do not fear when a man becomes rich, / When the glory of his house increases.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> For when he dies, he will take nothing; / His glory will not descend after him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> Though he blessed his soul while he lived — / And <i>men</i> praise you when you do good for yourself —<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> It will go to the generation of his fathers; / They will never see light.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> A man in honor but without understanding / Is like the beasts that perish.<br><br>
