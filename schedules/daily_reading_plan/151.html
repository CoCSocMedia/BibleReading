  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then Solomon said, Jehovah has said that He would dwell in deep darkness.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Yet I have built You a lofty house, even a place for You to dwell in forever.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And the king turned about and blessed all the congregation of Israel while all the congregation of Israel stood.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And he said, Blessed be Jehovah the God of Israel, who spoke with His mouth to David my father and fulfilled <i>it</i> with His hands, saying,<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> Since the day when I brought My people out from the land of Egypt, I have not chosen a city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house for My name that it might be there; nor did I choose a man to be a ruler over My people Israel;<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> But I have chosen Jerusalem that My name might be there, and I have chosen David to be over My people Israel.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And it was on David my fatherâ€™s heart to build a house for the name of Jehovah the God of Israel;<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> But Jehovah said to David my father, Because it was on your heart to build a house for My name, you have done well that it was on your heart;<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> However you will not build the house, but your son, who will come forth from your loins, he will build the house for My name.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And Jehovah has established His word which He spoke; for I have risen up in the place of David my father, and I sit upon the throne of Israel, as Jehovah promised, and I have built the house for the name of Jehovah the God of Israel.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And there I have set the Ark, in which is the covenant of Jehovah, which He made with the children of Israel.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> Then he stood before the altar of Jehovah in front of all the congregation of Israel and spread out his hands.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> Now Solomon had made a bronze platform, five cubits long and five cubits wide and three cubits high and had put it in the midst of the court; and he stood on it. Then he knelt on his knees in front of all the congregation of Israel and spread out his hands toward the heavens.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> And he said, O Jehovah, God of Israel, there is no god like You, in heaven or on earth, who keeps covenant and lovingkindness with Your servants who walk before You with all their heart;<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> <i>You</i> who have kept with Your servant David my father that which You have promised him; indeed You have spoken with Your mouth and have fulfilled with Your hand this day.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And now, O Jehovah, God of Israel, keep with Your servant David my father that which You promised him, saying, There shall not fail you a man in My sight to sit upon the throne of Israel, if only your children keep their way by walking in My law as you have walked before Me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> Now therefore, O Jehovah, God of Israel, may Your word that You spoke to Your servant David be confirmed.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> But will God indeed dwell with man on the earth? Behold, the heavens and the heaven of heavens are not able to contain You, how much less this house which I have built.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> Yet have regard to the prayer of Your servant and to his supplication, O Jehovah my God, and listen to the cry and to the prayer which Your servant is praying before You;<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> That Your eyes may be open toward this house day and night, toward the place of which You have said that <i>You would</i> put Your name there, to listen to the prayer which Your servant will pray toward this place.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And listen to the supplications of Your servant and of Your people Israel when they pray toward this place. Hear then from Your dwelling place, from the heavens; and when You hear, forgive.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> If a man sins against his neighbor and is made to take an oath, and he comes <i>and</i> takes an oath before Your altar in this house;<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> Then hear from the heavens and act and judge Your servants, repaying the wicked by bringing his way on his head and justifying the righteous by giving to him according to his righteousness.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> And if Your people Israel are defeated before an enemy because they have sinned against You, and they turn and confess Your name and pray and make supplication before You in this house;<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> Then hear from the heavens, and forgive the sin of Your people Israel, and bring them back to the land which You gave to them and to their fathers.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against You, and they pray toward this place and confess Your name <i>and</i> turn from their sin when You afflict them;<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> Then hear in the heavens and forgive the sin of Your servants and of Your people Israel; indeed teach them the good way in which they should walk, and bring rain upon Your land, which You have given to Your people for an inheritance.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> If there is famine in the land, if there is pestilence, if there is blight or mildew, swarming locust or consuming locust, if their enemies besiege them in the land of their cities, whatever plague, and whatever sickness <i>there is;</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> Whatever prayer, whatever supplication, which will be made by any man or by all Your people Israel, each knowing his own plague and his own pain, when he spreads out his hands toward this house;<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> Then hear from the heavens Your dwelling place, and forgive and render to each man according to all his ways, whose heart You know; for You, You alone know the hearts of the children of men;<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> That they may fear You to walk in Your ways all the days that they live in the land which You have given to our fathers.<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> And also concerning the foreigner, who is not of Your people Israel but comes from a distant country for the sake of Your great name and Your strong hand and Your outstretched arm, when they come and pray toward this house;<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> Then hear from the heavens, from Your dwelling place, and act according to all that the foreigner calls upon You for, that all the peoples of the earth may know Your name and that they may fear You, as do Your people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by Your name.<br><br>
     <sup><b>34</b></sup> If Your people go out to battle against their enemies by the way which You have sent them, and they pray to You toward this city which You have chosen and the house which I have built for Your name;<br><br>
     <sup><b>35</b></sup> Then hear their prayer and their supplication from the heavens, and maintain their cause.<br><br>
     <sup><b>36</b></sup> If they have sinned against You (for there is no man who does not sin) and You are angry with them and deliver them up to the enemy, so that they are carried away captive unto a land, far away or nearby;<br><br>
     <sup><b>37</b></sup> But if they take it to heart in the land where they were carried captive, and they repent and make supplication to You in the land of those who carried them away captive, saying, We have sinned <i>and</i> committed iniquity and acted wickedly;<br><br>
     <sup><b>38</b></sup> And <i>if</i> they return to You with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, where they have been carried captive, and they pray toward their land that You have given to their fathers, and the city that You have chosen, and to the house that I have built for Your name;<br><br>
     <sup><b>39</b></sup> Then hear their prayer and their supplications from the heavens, from Your dwelling place, and maintain their cause, and forgive Your people who have sinned against You.<br><br>
     <sup><b>40</b></sup> Now, O my God, may Your eyes be open and Your ears attentive to the prayer <i>that is made</i> in this place.<br><br>
     <sup><b>41</b></sup> And now arise, O Jehovah God, to Your resting place, / You and the Ark of Your strength. / Let Your priests, O Jehovah God, be clothed with salvation, / And let Your saints rejoice in what is good.<br><br>
     <sup><b>42</b></sup> O Jehovah God, do not turn away the face of Your anointed one, / Remember Your lovingkindness to David Your servant.<br><br>
