  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel (for he was the firstborn; but because he defiled his father’s bed, his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph the son of Israel; but he was not to be enrolled in the genealogy according to the birthright,<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> For Judah prevailed among his brothers, and from him was the leader, but the birthright was Joseph’s) —<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel: Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> The sons of Joel: Shemaiah his son, Gog his son, Shimei his son,<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> Micah his son, Reaiah his son, Baal his son,<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> Beerah his son, whom Tilgath-pilneser the king of Assyria carried away captive; he was the leader of the Reubenites.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And his brothers by their families, in the genealogical enrollment of their generations, were: Jeiel the chief and Zechariah<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And Bela the son of Azaz, the son of Shema, the son of Joel, who dwelt in Aroer, as far as Nebo and Baal-meon;<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> And he dwelt on the east as far as the entrance to the wilderness from the river Euphrates; for their cattle were multiplied in the land of Gilead.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And in the days of Saul they waged war with the Hagarites, who fell by their hand; and they dwelt in their tents throughout the east side of Gilead.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And the children of Gad dwelt opposite them in the land of Bashan as far as Salecah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> Joel was the head and Shapham the next, then Jaanai, and Shaphat in Bashan.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> And their brothers according to their fathers’ houses were Michael and Meshullam and Sheba and Jorai and Jacan and Zia and Eber, seven.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> These were the sons of Abihail, the son of Huri, the son of Jaroah, the son of Gilead, the son of Michael, the son of Jeshishai, the son of Jahdo, the son of Buz:<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> Ahi the son of Abdiel, the son of Guni, was the head of their fathers’ house.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And they dwelt in Gilead in Bashan and in its towns and in all the pasture lands of Sharon as far as their limits.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> All these were enrolled in genealogies in the days of Jotham the king of Judah and in the days of Jeroboam the king of Israel.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> The children of Reuben and the Gadites and half the tribe of Manasseh were among the valiant men, men who carried shield and sword, and drew the bow and were skillful in war — forty-four thousand seven hundred sixty ready for war.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> And they waged war with the Hagarites and Jetur and Naphish and Nodab;<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> And they were helped against them, and the Hagarites were delivered into their hand, as well as all who were with them; for they cried out to God in the battle, and He was entreated for them because they trusted in Him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And they took their livestock: their fifty thousand camels, and two hundred fifty thousand sheep, and two thousand donkeys, as well as one hundred thousand people.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> For many fell down slain, for the war was of God. And they dwelt in their place until the captivity.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> And the children of the half-tribe of Manasseh dwelt in the land, from Bashan as far as Baal-hermon and Senir and Mount Hermon; they were many.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> And these were the heads of their fathers’ houses: Epher and Ishi and Eliel and Azriel and Jeremiah and Hodaviah and Jahdiel, mighty men of valor, famous men, heads of their fathers’ houses.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> But they trespassed against the God of their fathers, and went as harlots after the gods of the peoples of the land, whom God had destroyed before them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> And the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul the king of Assyria and the spirit of Tilgath-pilneser the king of Assyria; and He carried them away, the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh, and brought them to Halah and Habor and Hara and to the river Gozan, <i>where they are</i> to this day.<br><br>
