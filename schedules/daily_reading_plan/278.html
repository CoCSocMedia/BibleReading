  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> My God, my God, why have You forsaken me? / <i>Why are You</i> so far from saving me, / <i>From</i> the words of my groaning?<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> O my God, I call out in the day, but You do not answer; / And in the night, but there is no rest for me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> But You are holy, You who sit <i>enthroned</i> / Upon the praises of Israel.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> In You our fathers trusted; / They trusted and You rescued them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> To You they cried out and were delivered; / In You they trusted and were not put to shame.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> But I am a worm and not a man, / A reproach of men and one despised by the people.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> All who see me deride me; / They sneer at <i>me;</i> they shake their heads, <i>saying,</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> He committed himself to Jehovah; let Him rescue him; / Let Him deliver him since He takes pleasure in him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> But You are the One who drew me forth from the womb, / Who made me trust <i>while</i> at my mother’s breasts.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> I was cast upon You from birth; / From my mother’s womb You have been my God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> Do not be far from me, / For trouble is near, / For there is none to help <i>me.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> Many bulls surround me; / The mighty <i>bulls</i> of Bashan encompass me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> They open their mouth at me, / <i>Like</i> a ravening and roaring lion.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> I am poured out like water, / And all my bones are out of joint. / My heart is like wax; / It is melted within me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> My strength is dried up like a shard, / And my tongue is stuck to my jaws; / You have put me in the dust of death.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> For dogs surround me; / A company of evildoers encloses me; / They pierce my hands and feet.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> I count all my bones; / They look, they stare at me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> They divide my garments to themselves, / And for my clothing they cast lots.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> But You, O Jehovah, be not far off; / O my help, hasten to aid me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> Deliver my soul from the sword, / My precious life from the power of the dog;<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> Save me from the mouth of the lion; / Indeed while I am in the horns of wild oxen, answer me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> I will declare Your name to my brothers; / In the midst of the assembly I will praise You.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> You who fear Jehovah, praise Him! / All you seed of Jacob, glorify Him! / And stand in awe of Him, all you seed of Israel!<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> For He has not despised nor detested / The affliction of him who is afflicted; / And He has not hidden His face from him; / But when he cried out to Him, He heard.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> From You <i>comes</i> my praise in the great assembly; / My vows will I pay before those who fear Him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> The lowly will eat and be satisfied; / Those who seek after Jehovah will praise Him — / May your hearts live forever!<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> All the ends of the earth / Will remember and return to Jehovah, / And all families of the nations / Will worship before You;<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> For the kingdom is Jehovah’s, / And He rules among the nations.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> All the flourishing of the earth / Will eat and worship. / All who go down into the dust will bow down before Him, / Even he who does not keep his soul alive.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> A seed will serve Him; / That which concerns the Lord will be told to a <i>coming</i> generation.<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> They will come and declare His righteousness / To a people <i>yet</i> to be born, that He has done <i>this.</i><br><br>
