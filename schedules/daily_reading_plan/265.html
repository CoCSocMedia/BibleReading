  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> I will give thanks to <i>You,</i> O Jehovah, with all my heart; / I will tell out all Your wonders.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> I will rejoice and exult in You; / I will sing psalms to Your name, O Most High.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> When my enemies turn back, / They stumble and perish at Your presence.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> For You have upheld my right and my cause; / You sit on the throne, judging righteously.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> You have rebuked the nations; You have destroyed the wicked; / You have blotted out their name forever and ever.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> The enemies are finished; <i>they are in</i> perpetual ruins; / And You have uprooted <i>their</i> cities; the very memory of them has perished.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> But Jehovah sits <i>enthroned</i> forever; / He has established His throne for judgment.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And it is He who judges the world with righteousness; / He executes judgment on the peoples with equity.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> And Jehovah is a high retreat for the oppressed, / A high retreat in times of distress.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And those who know Your name put their trust in You, / For You have not forsaken those who seek You, O Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> Sing psalms to Jehovah, the Inhabitant of Zion; / Declare His deeds among the peoples,<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> For He who avenges bloodshed remembers those <i>who were slain;</i> / He does not forget the cry of the afflicted.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> Be gracious to me, O Jehovah; look on my affliction from those who hate me, / You who raise me from the gates of death,<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> That I may tell out all Your praises / <i>And,</i> in the gates of the daughter of Zion, exult in Your salvation.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> The nations have sunk in the pit that they have made; / In the net that they hid, their own foot is caught.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> Jehovah has made Himself known; He has executed justice; / The wicked have been snared in the work of their hands. Higgaion. Selah<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> The wicked will be turned back to Sheol, / All the nations who forget God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> For not always will the needy be forgotten, / Nor will the hope of the afflicted perish forever.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> Arise, O Jehovah! Let not mortal man prevail; / Let the nations be judged in Your sight.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> Put them in fear, O Jehovah; / Let the nations know that they are mortal men. Selah<br><br>
