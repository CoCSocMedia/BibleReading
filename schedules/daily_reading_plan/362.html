  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Hallelujah. / Give thanks to Jehovah, for He is good, / For His lovingkindness is forever.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Who can utter the mighty acts of Jehovah, / <i>Or</i> declare all His praise?<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> Blessed are those who maintain justice, / Who execute righteousness at all times.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Remember me, O Jehovah, with <i>Your</i> favor toward Your people; / Visit me with Your salvation,<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> That I may see the prosperity of Your chosen ones, / That I may rejoice in the joy of Your nation, / That I may glory with Your inheritance.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> We have sinned with our fathers; / We committed iniquity; we have acted wickedly.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Our fathers in Egypt / Did not understand Your wonders; / They did not remember the multitude of Your acts of lovingkindness, / But rebelled by the sea, at the Red Sea.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> But He saved them for His name’s sake, / That He might make His power known.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> Thus He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up; / And He led them through the depths as through the wilderness.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And He saved them from the hand of him who hated <i>them,</i> / And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> The water then covered their adversaries; / Not one of them was left.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> Then they believed His words; / They sang His praise.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> Soon they forgot His works; / They did not wait for His counsel,<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, / And tempted God in the desert.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And He gave them their request, / But He sent leanness into their soul.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And they were jealous of Moses in the camp / <i>And</i> of Aaron, the holy one of Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> The earth opened, and it swallowed up Dathan / And covered the company of Abiram.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> And a fire burned among their company; / A flame engulfed the wicked.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> They made a calf in Horeb, / And worshipped a molten image.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> Thus they exchanged their glory / For the image of an ox that eats grass.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> They forgot God their Savior, / Who had done great things in Egypt,<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> Wondrous deeds in the land of Ham, / Awesome things by the Red Sea.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> Therefore He said that He would destroy them, / <i>And would have,</i> had not Moses His chosen one / Stood in the breach before Him / To turn away His wrath from destroying <i>them.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> Then they despised the pleasant land; / They did not believe in His word;<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> Rather they murmured in their tents; / They did not listen to the voice of Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> Therefore He lifted up His hand <i>and swore</i> to them / That He would make them fall in the wilderness,<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> And that He would make their seed fall among the nations, / And that He would disperse them among the lands.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> Then they joined themselves to Baal-peor, / And ate sacrifices <i>offered</i> to the dead.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> Thus they provoked <i>Him</i> to anger by their actions, / And the plague broke out among them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> Then Phinehas stood up and intervened, / And the plague was stayed;<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> And it has been accounted to him as righteousness / From generation to generation unto eternity.<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> Then they angered <i>Him</i> at the waters of Meribah, / So that it went ill with Moses on account of them;<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> For they rebelled against His Spirit, / And he spoke rashly with his lips.<br><br>
     <sup><b>34</b></sup> They did not destroy the peoples, / As Jehovah had commanded them;<br><br>
     <sup><b>35</b></sup> But they mingled themselves with the nations / And learned their practices.<br><br>
     <sup><b>36</b></sup> And they served their idols, / Which became a snare to them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>37</b></sup> They also sacrificed their sons / And their daughters to demons,<br><br>
     <sup><b>38</b></sup> And poured out innocent blood, / The blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan; / And the land was polluted with bloodshed.<br><br>
     <sup><b>39</b></sup> Thus they were defiled by their practices, / And went about as harlots by their actions.<br><br>
     <sup><b>40</b></sup> And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against His people, / And He abhorred His inheritance.<br><br>
     <sup><b>41</b></sup> And He gave them over into the hand of the nations: / And those who hated them ruled over them,<br><br>
     <sup><b>42</b></sup> And their enemies oppressed them, / And they were subdued under their hand.<br><br>
     <sup><b>43</b></sup> Many times He delivered them, / But they were rebellious in their counsel, / And they were brought low in their iniquity.<br><br>
     <sup><b>44</b></sup> Yet He regarded their distress / When He heard their cry,<br><br>
     <sup><b>45</b></sup> And for their sake He remembered His covenant, / And repented according to the multitude of His acts of lovingkindness;<br><br>
     <sup><b>46</b></sup> And He caused them to find compassion / With all their captors.<br><br>
     <sup><b>47</b></sup> Save us, O Jehovah our God; / And gather us out of the nations, / That we may give thanks to Your holy name, / That we may glory in Your praise.<br><br>
     <sup><b>48</b></sup> Blessed be Jehovah the God of Israel, / From eternity to eternity. / And let all the people say, Amen. / Hallelujah.<br><br>
