  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Hezekiah began to reign at the age of twenty-five years, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And he did what was right in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that David his father had done.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> He, in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of Jehovah and repaired them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And he brought in the priests and the Levites and gathered them at the east square.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And he said to them, Listen to me, you Levites: Sanctify yourselves now, and sanctify the house of Jehovah, the God of your fathers; and bring out the impurity from the holy place.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> For our fathers were unfaithful and did what was evil in the sight of Jehovah our God, and they forsook Him and turned their faces from the dwelling place of Jehovah, and they turned their backs <i>on Him.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> They also shut up the doors of the portico and extinguished the lamps; and they did not burn the incense, nor did they offer up the burnt offering in the holy place to the God of Israel.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> Therefore the wrath of Jehovah was upon Judah and Jerusalem, and He made them an object of horror, astonishment, and hissing, as you see with your own eyes.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> For indeed, our fathers fell by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are captives because of this.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> Now it is on my heart to make a covenant with Jehovah the God of Israel, that His burning anger may turn away from us.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> My sons, do not now be negligent, for Jehovah has chosen you to stand before Him to minister to Him and to be His ministers and burn incense.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> Then the Levites rose up: Mahath the son of Amasai and Joel the son of Azariah, from among the sons of the Kohathites; and from among the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi and Azariah the son of Jehallelel; and of the Gershonites, Joah the son of Zimmah and Eden the son of Joah;<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> And of the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeuel; and of the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah;<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> And of the sons of Heman, Jehuel and Shimei; and of the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And they gathered their brothers together and sanctified themselves. And they went in, according to the command of the king by the words of Jehovah, to cleanse the house of Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And the priests went into the inner part of the house of Jehovah to cleanse <i>it;</i> and they brought out into the court of the house of Jehovah all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of Jehovah, and the Levites took <i>it</i> to carry <i>it</i> outside to the brook Kidron.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> And they began on the first <i>day</i> of the first month to sanctify <i>the house,</i> and on the eighth day of the month they came to the portico of Jehovah; then they sanctified the house of Jehovah for eight days, and on the sixteenth day of the first month they finished.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> Then they went in to Hezekiah the king and said, We have cleansed the whole house of Jehovah: the altar of burnt offering with all its vessels and the table of the rows <i>of bread</i> with all its vessels.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> And all the vessels that King Ahaz cast out during his reign when he trespassed we have prepared and sanctified, and they are now before the altar of Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> Then Hezekiah the king rose up early and gathered all the leaders of the city and went up to the house of Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And they brought seven bulls and seven rams and seven lambs and seven male goats as a sin offering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for Judah. And he ordered the sons of Aaron, the priests, to offer <i>them</i> up on the altar of Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> So they slaughtered the cattle, and the priests took the blood and sprinkled <i>it</i> on the altar; then they slaughtered the rams and sprinkled the blood on the altar, and they slaughtered the lambs and sprinkled the blood on the altar.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> Then they brought the male goats of the sin offering before the king and the congregation, and they laid their hands on them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> And the priests slaughtered them and offered their blood as a sin offering upon the altar to make expiation for all Israel, for the king had commanded the burnt offering and the sin offering for all Israel.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> And he set the Levites in the house of Jehovah with cymbals, with harps, and with lyres in the way David and Gad the king’s seer and Nathan the prophet had commanded, for the commandment was from Jehovah through His prophets.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests, with the trumpets.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> And Hezekiah ordered the offering up of the burnt offering at the altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song of Jehovah began <i>also,</i> as well as the trumpets with the accompaniment of the instruments of David the king of Israel.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> And the whole congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters trumpeted — all this until the burnt offering was finished.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> And when the offering was finished, the king and all who were found with him bowed down and worshipped.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> And Hezekiah the king and the leaders commanded the Levites to praise Jehovah with the words of David and of Asaph the seer. And they praised with rejoicing and bowed down and worshipped.<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> Then Hezekiah responded and said, Now you have consecrated yourselves to Jehovah; come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings to the house of Jehovah. So the congregation brought sacrifices and thank offerings, and all who were willing in heart <i>brought</i> burnt offerings.<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> And the number of burnt offerings that the congregation brought was seventy cattle, one hundred rams, <i>and</i> two hundred lambs; all these were for a burnt offering to Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> And the things consecrated were six hundred cattle and three thousand sheep;<br><br>
     <sup><b>34</b></sup> However the priests were too few and could not flay all the burnt offerings, so their brothers the Levites aided them until the work was finished and until the <i>rest of the</i> priests had sanctified themselves, for the Levites were more upright in heart than the priests in sanctifying themselves.<br><br>
     <sup><b>35</b></sup> And besides the abundance of burnt offerings there were also the fat of the peace offerings and the drink offerings for the burnt offerings. So the service of the house of Jehovah was established.<br><br>
     <sup><b>36</b></sup> And Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced over what God had prepared for the people, for the thing had happened so suddenly.<br><br>
