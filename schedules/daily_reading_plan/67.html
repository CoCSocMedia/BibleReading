  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And David spoke the words of this song to Jehovah on the day when Jehovah delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And he said: Jehovah is my crag and my fortress and my Deliverer;<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> My God, my rock, in whom I take refuge; / My shield and the horn of my salvation, my high retreat and my refuge; / My Savior, You save me from violence.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> I called upon Jehovah, who is worthy of praise, / And from my enemies I was saved.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> For the waves of death encompassed me; / The torrents of destruction assailed me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> The cords of Sheol surrounded me; / The snares of death confronted me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> In my distress I called upon Jehovah / And called to my God. / And He heard my voice from His temple, / And my cry <i>came</i> to His ears.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> Then the earth shook and quaked, / And the foundations of the heavens trembled and shook about, / For He was furious.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> Smoke went up from His nostrils, / And fire from His mouth devoured; / Coals blazed forth from Him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> He bowed the heavens down and descended, / And deep darkness was under His feet.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> He rode upon a cherub and did fly; / He was seen upon the wings of the wind.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And He made darkness pavilions around Him: / Dark waterclouds, thick clouds of the skies.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> Out of the brightness before Him / Fiery coals were kindled.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> Jehovah thundered from heaven, / And the Most High uttered His voice.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And He sent forth arrows and scattered my enemies; / Lightning bolts, and discomfited them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> The channels of the sea were seen, / The foundations of the habitable land were laid bare, / By the rebuke of Jehovah, / At the blast of the breath of His nostrils.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> He reached forth from on high; He took me; / He drew me out of great waters.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> He delivered me from my strong enemy / And from those who hate me, for they were too mighty for me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> They confronted me in the day of my calamity, / But Jehovah became my support.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> He brought me forth to a place broad and free; / He rescued me, for He took delight in me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> Jehovah has recompensed me according to my righteousness; / According to the cleanness of my hands He has repaid me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> For I have kept the ways of Jehovah / And have not acted wickedly <i>by turning</i> away from my God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> For all His judgments were before me, / And as for His statutes, I did not turn away from them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> I was perfect toward Him, / And I kept myself from my iniquity.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> Therefore Jehovah recompensed me according to my righteousness, / According to my cleanness in His sight.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> With the faithful You show Yourself faithful, / With the perfect man You show Yourself perfect,<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> With the pure You show Yourself pure, / And with the perverse You show Yourself contrary.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> And You save the afflicted people, / But Your eyes are upon the haughty that You may bring <i>them</i> down;<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> For You are my lamp, O Jehovah. / And Jehovah lights up my darkness;<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> For by You I can run up against a troop; / By my God I can leap over a wall.<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> As for God, His way is perfect; / The word of Jehovah is tried. / He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> For who is God other than Jehovah, / And who is a rock except our God?<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> God is my strong fortress, / And He makes my way perfect;<br><br>
     <sup><b>34</b></sup> He makes my feet like hinds’ <i>feet</i> / And sets me on my high places;<br><br>
     <sup><b>35</b></sup> He teaches my hands to wage war / So that my arms may bend a bronze bow.<br><br>
     <sup><b>36</b></sup> And You have given me the shield of Your salvation, / And Your condescending gentleness has made me great.<br><br>
     <sup><b>37</b></sup> You have broadened the places of my steps under me, / And my feet have not slipped.<br><br>
     <sup><b>38</b></sup> I pursued my enemies and destroyed them, / And I did not turn back until they were consumed.<br><br>
     <sup><b>39</b></sup> And I devoured them and shattered them, so that they did not rise up; / Indeed, they have fallen under my feet.<br><br>
     <sup><b>40</b></sup> And You girded me with strength for war; / You brought down under me those who rose up against me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>41</b></sup> You also made my enemies turn <i>their</i> back to me, / And I annihilated those who hated me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>42</b></sup> They looked, but there was no one to save <i>them;</i> / <i>They looked</i> to Jehovah, but He did not answer them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>43</b></sup> Then I beat them like the dust of the earth; / I pounded them, I stamped them, like the mud of the streets.<br><br>
     <sup><b>44</b></sup> And You rescued me from the strivings of my people; / You have kept me <i>as</i> the head of the nations; / A people whom I have not known serves me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>45</b></sup> Foreigners come cringing to me; / At the <i>mere</i> hearing of a report, they obey me;<br><br>
     <sup><b>46</b></sup> Foreigners are discouraged / And come quaking out of their fortresses.<br><br>
     <sup><b>47</b></sup> Jehovah lives; and blessed be my rock, / And exalted be God, the rock of my salvation,<br><br>
     <sup><b>48</b></sup> The God who executes vengeance for me / And brings down peoples under me,<br><br>
     <sup><b>49</b></sup> And who brings me forth from my enemies. / Yes, You exalted me above those who rise up against me; / From the violent man You delivered me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>50</b></sup> Therefore I give thanks to You among the nations, O Jehovah; / And I sing psalms to Your name.<br><br>
     <sup><b>51</b></sup> <i>It is He</i> who magnifies salvation to His king / And executes lovingkindness to His anointed, / To David and to his seed forever.<br><br>
