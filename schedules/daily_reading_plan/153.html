  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And at the end of the twenty years in which Solomon had built the house of Jehovah and his own house,<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> He built the cities which Huram had given to him and settled the children of Israel there.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> Then Solomon went to Hamath-zobah and overcame it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And he built Tadmor in the wilderness and all the storage cities which he built in Hamath.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And he built upper Beth-horon and lower Beth-horon, fortified cities with walls, gates, and bars,<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And Baalath and all the storage cities that Solomon had, even all the cities for the chariots, and the cities for the horsemen and all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem and in Lebanon and in all the land of his dominion.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> All the people who were left of the Hittites and the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites, who were not of Israel,<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> From their descendants who were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel had not destroyed utterly, these Solomon levied as forced labor, <i>as they are</i> unto this day.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> But Solomon did not make slaves of the children of Israel for his work, for they were the men of war and the officers over his captains and the officers over his chariots and his horsemen.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And these were the chief of the officers of King Solomon, two hundred fifty, who ruled over the people.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> Then Solomon brought up Pharaoh’s daughter from the city of David into the house which he had built for her; for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David the king of Israel, for the places where the Ark of Jehovah has entered are holy.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> Then Solomon offered up burnt offerings to Jehovah on the altar of Jehovah which he had built before the portico,<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> Even as required daily, offering <i>them</i> up according to the commandment of Moses, on the Sabbaths and on the new moons and on the appointed feasts three times in a year, at the Feast of Unleavened Bread and at the Feast of Weeks and at the Feast of Tabernacles.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> And according to the ordinance of David his father, he appointed the divisions of the priests for their service, and the Levites for their charges to praise and to minister before the priests even as required daily, and the gatekeepers by their divisions at every gate; for thus was the commandment of David the man of God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And they did not turn aside from the commandment of the king concerning the priests and the Levites concerning any matter and concerning the treasuries.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> So all the work of Solomon was carried out, from the day of the foundation of the house of Jehovah even until its completion. <i>Thus</i> the house of Jehovah was finished.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> Then Solomon went to Ezion-geber and to Eloth on the shore of the sea, in the land of Edom.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> And Huram sent him ships by his servants, and servants who knew the sea; and they went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir and took four hundred fifty talents of gold from there and brought <i>it</i> to King Solomon.<br><br>
