  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then Job answered and said,<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Oh that my vexation were weighed indeed, / And that my ruin were lifted onto the scales together with <i>it!</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> For then it would be heavier than the sand of the seas; / Therefore my words have been rash.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> For the arrows of the Almighty are in me, / The poison of which my spirit drinks up; / The terrors of God are arrayed against me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> Does the wild ass bray over <i>its</i> grass? / Or does the ox low over its fodder?<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> Is what is savorless eaten without salt? / Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> My soul refuses to touch <i>them;</i> / They are like putrid food to me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> Oh that I might have my request, / And that God would grant <i>me</i> what I long for;<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> That God would be willing to crush me; / That He would release His hand and cut me off!<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> Then there would still be comfort for me; / And I would exult, <i>even</i> in writhing pain that does not spare, / That I did not deny the words of the Holy One.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> What is my strength, that I should wait? / And what is my end, that I should be patient?<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> Is my strength the strength of stones? / Or is my flesh bronze?<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> Is there any help for me at all within me, / And has wisdom been driven away from me?<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> To him who is fainting <i>there should be</i> kindness from his friend, / Else he will forsake the fear of the Almighty.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> My brothers have dealt as treacherously as a desert brook, / As the rivulets of the desert brooks that pass away,<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> Which are turbid because of the ice, / <i>And</i> into which the snow hides itself.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> When they are scorched, they are completely consumed; / When it is hot, they are dried up from their place.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> Caravans divert their ways <i>for them;</i> / They go up into the waste and perish.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> The caravans of Tema look <i>for them;</i> / The companies of Sheba long for them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> They are put to shame because they are confident; / They go there and are confounded.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> So now you have become such; / You see a terrible thing and are afraid.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> Have I said, Give me <i>something?</i> / Or, Pay a bribe for me out of your wealth?<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> Or, Deliver me from the hand of the adversary? / Or, From the hand of the oppressors redeem me?<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> Teach me, and I will be silent; / Cause me to understand how I have erred.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> How forceful are upright words! / But what does <i>this</i> reproving from you reprove?<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> Do you think you can reprove words? / But the words of a desperate man are for the wind.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> You would even cast <i>lots</i> over the orphan / And bargain over your friend.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> Now then be pleased to look upon me, / For surely I will not lie to your face.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> Turn now; let there be no injustice. / Indeed turn; my righteousness is still here.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> Is there any injustice on my tongue? / Can my palate not discern calamities?<br><br>
