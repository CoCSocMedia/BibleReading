  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And Ahaziah fell through the lattice in his upper chamber which was in Samaria and became ill. And he sent messengers and said to them, Go <i>and</i> inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron whether I will recover from this sickness.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> But the Angel of Jehovah said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise; go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria and say to them, Is it because there is no God in Israel that you go to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron?<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Now therefore thus says Jehovah, You shall not come down from the bed on which you have gone up, but you shall surely die. And Elijah departed.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And when the messengers returned to him, he said to them, Why have you returned?<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And they said to him, A man came up to meet us and said to us, Go <i>and</i> return to the king who sent you, and say to him, Thus says Jehovah, Is it because there is no God in Israel that you send <i>men</i> to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron? Therefore you shall not come down from the bed on which you have gone up, but you shall surely die.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And he said to them, What sort of man was he who came up to meet you and spoke these words to you?<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And they said to him, A hairy man, and he was girded with a leather girdle around his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> And he sent a captain of fifty with his fifty to him. And <i>the captain</i> went up to him, and there he was, sitting on the top of the hill. And he said to him, O man of God, the king says, Come down!<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty. Then fire came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And again <i>the king</i> sent another captain of fifty with his fifty. And <i>the captain</i> answered and said to him, O man of God, thus says the king, Come down quickly.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And Elijah answered and said to them, If I am the man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> And again <i>the king</i> sent a captain of a third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up; and he came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and he entreated him and said to him, O man of God, may my soul and the soul of these fifty servants of yours be precious in your sight.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> Already fire has come down from heaven and consumed the first two captains of fifty and their fifties; and now may my soul be precious in your sight.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And the Angel of Jehovah said to Elijah, Go down with him; do not be afraid of him. And he rose up and went down with him to the king.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> Then he said to him, Thus says Jehovah, Because you sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron — was it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of His word? — therefore you shall not come down from the bed on which you have gone up, but you shall surely die.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> And he died according to the word of Jehovah which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram began to reign in his place in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, because he had no son.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> And the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?<br><br>
