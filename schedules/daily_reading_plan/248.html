  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then Elihu continued and said,<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Hear my words, you wise men; / And you who know, give ear to me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> For the ear tries words / As the palate tastes food.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Let us choose for ourselves what is right; / Let us know among ourselves what is good.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> For Job has said, I am righteous, / And God has taken away my right;<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> Should I lie against my right? / My arrow wound is incurable, <i>though I am</i> without transgression.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> What man is like Job, / Who drinks up scoffing like water,<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> Who goes in company with the workers of iniquity / And walks with wicked men?<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> For he has said, It does not profit a man / To delight himself in God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> Therefore, you men of understanding, hear me: / Far be it from God that He would do evil, / And from the Almighty that He would commit iniquity.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> For He will render a man’s work to him / And will cause a man to find that which is according to his own way.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> Indeed in all certainty God will not do evil, / And the Almighty will not pervert justice.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> Who has <i>ever</i> put the earth in His charge? / Or who has <i>ever</i> set <i>in order</i> the whole world?<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> If He were to consider Himself <i>only,</i> / He would gather back to Himself His spirit and His breath;<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> All flesh would perish together, / And man would return to dust.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> If then <i>you have</i> understanding, hear this; / Give ear to the voice of my words.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> Shall one who hates justice govern? / And will you condemn the just <i>and</i> mighty One,<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> He who says to a king, You worthless one! / <i>And</i> to nobles, You wicked one!<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> He who does not respect the persons of princes, / Nor regard the rich man more than the poor, / For they are all the work of His hands?<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> In a moment they die, and in the middle of the night / The people are shaken, and they pass away; / And the mighty are taken away, <i>but</i> by no <i>human</i> hand.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> For His eyes are upon the ways of a man, / And He sees all his steps.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> There is no darkness and no shadow of death / Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> For He does not <i>need</i> to consider a man further, / That he should go to God in litigation.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> He breaks mighty men in pieces without inquiry / And puts others in their stead.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> Hence He knows their actions, / And He overturns <i>them</i> in the night so that they are crushed.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> He strikes them as He would evil men, / In a place where <i>all</i> can see;<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> Because they turned aside from following after Him / And would not regard any of His ways,<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> So that they caused the cry of the poor to come to Him, / And He heard the cry of the afflicted.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> When He is silent, who can condemn <i>Him?</i> / When He hides His face, who can behold Him? / <i>He does so</i> toward a nation and toward a man alike,<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> That no profane man would reign, that there would be no snares for the people.<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> For has anyone <i>ever</i> said to God, / I have borne <i>chastisement;</i> I will offend no more;<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> What I do not see teach me; / If I have committed iniquity, I will do it no more?<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> Should He recompense to fit you, since you have rejected <i>it?</i> / For you must choose, and not I. / So speak what you know.<br><br>
     <sup><b>34</b></sup> Men of understanding will say to me, / As well as the man of wisdom who hears me,<br><br>
     <sup><b>35</b></sup> Job has spoken without knowledge, / And his words are without insight.<br><br>
     <sup><b>36</b></sup> I wish that Job were tried to the limit / Because of his answering like evil men.<br><br>
     <sup><b>37</b></sup> For he adds rebellion to his sin; / Among us he claps <i>his hands</i> / And multiplies his words against God.<br><br>
