  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And the divisions of the sons of Aaron <i>were these:</i> the sons of Aaron: Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> But Nadab and Abihu died before their father and had no children; therefore Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And David with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar divided them according to their offices in their service.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Since more chief men were found among the sons of Eleazar than the sons of Ithamar, they were divided <i>thus:</i> of the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen, heads of fathers’ houses; and of the sons of Ithamar, according to their fathers’ houses, eight.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And they were divided by lot, each like the others; for there were officers of the sanctuary and officers of God, both from the sons of Eleazar and from the sons of Ithamar.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And Shemaiah the son of Nethanel the scribe, from among the Levites, recorded them in the presence of the king and the leaders and Zadok the priest and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar and the heads of the fathers’ <i>houses</i> of the priests and of the Levites, one fathers’ house being drawn for Eleazar and one drawn for Ithamar.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> The third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> The fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin,<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> The seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah,<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> The ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah,<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> The eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim,<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> The thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> The fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer,<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> The seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Happizzez,<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> The nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezkel,<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> The twenty-first to Jachin, the twenty-second to Gamul,<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> The twenty-third to Delaiah, the twenty-fourth to Maaziah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> These were their offices in their service for coming into the house of Jehovah according to the arrangement <i>given</i> to them by Aaron their father, as Jehovah the God of Israel had commanded him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> And of the rest of the sons of Levi: of the sons of Amram, Shubael; of the sons of Shubael, Jehdeiah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> Of Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, Isshiah the chief.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> Of the Izharites, Shelomoth; of the sons of Shelomoth, Jahath.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> And the sons <i>of Hebron:</i> Jeriah <i>the chief,</i> Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> The sons of Uzziel, Micah; of the sons of Micah, Shamir.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> The brother of Micah, Isshiah; of the sons of Isshiah, Zechariah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi; the sons of Jaaziah: Beno.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> The sons of Merari: of Jaaziah were Beno and Shoham and Zaccur and Ibri.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> Of Mahli: Eleazar, who had no sons.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> Of Kish: the sons of Kish: Jerahmeel.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> And the sons of Mushi: Mahli and Eder and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the Levites according to their fathers’ houses.<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> These likewise cast lots even as their brothers the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king and Zadok and Ahimelech and the heads of the fathers’ <i>houses</i> of the priests and of the Levites, the head of the fathers’ <i>houses</i> even as his younger brother.<br><br>
