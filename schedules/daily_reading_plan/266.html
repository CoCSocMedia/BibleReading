  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Why, O Jehovah, do You stand far off? / <i>Why</i> do You hide Yourself in times of distress?<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Arrogantly the wicked hotly pursue the poor — / May they be caught in the plots that they devise!<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> For the wicked man boasts of the desire of his soul, / And the rapacious man curses, <i>even</i> despises, Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> The wicked man, according to the haughtiness of his countenance, / <i>Says,</i> He will not require <i>it;</i> / All his thoughts are <i>this:</i> There is no God!<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> His ways succeed at all times; / Your judgments are on high, out of his sight; / As for all his adversaries, he snorts at them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> He has said in his heart, I will not be shaken; / I will be in no trouble forever.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> His mouth is full of curses and of deceit and oppression; / Under his tongue are mischief and iniquity.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> He sits in the ambushes of the open villages; / In hidden places he murders the innocent; / His eyes secretly watch for the unfortunate.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> He lurks in secret like a lion in <i>its</i> covert; / He lurks <i>ready</i> to seize the poor; / He seizes the poor, drawing <i>them</i> up in his net.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> He stoops, he crouches, / And the unfortunate fall by his mighty <i>claws.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> He has said in his heart, God has forgotten; / He has hidden His face; He will never see <i>this.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> Arise, O Jehovah; O God, lift up Your hand. / Do not forget the poor.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> Why does the wicked man despise God / <i>And</i> say in his heart, You will not require <i>it?</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> You do see! For You observe mischief and vexation, / To requite <i>it</i> with Your own hand. / To You the unfortunate one commits <i>his cause;</i> / You have been the help of the orphan.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> Break the arm of the wicked man and the evildoer; / Seek out his wickedness until You find no more.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> Jehovah is King forever and ever; / The nations have perished from His land.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> You have heard the desire of the lowly, O Jehovah; / You will establish their heart; You will cause Your ears to listen,<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> In order to execute justice for the orphan and the oppressed one, / That the mortal man of the earth may terrorize no longer.<br><br>
