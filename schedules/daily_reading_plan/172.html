  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Jotham was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Jerusha, the daughter of Zadok.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And he did what was right in the sight of Jehovah according to all that his father Uzziah had done; only he did not enter into the temple of Jehovah. Yet the people still acted corruptly.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> He built the upper gate of the house of Jehovah and built much on the wall of the Ophel.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And he built cities in the hill country of Judah, and in the forests he built fortresses and towers.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And he fought with the king of the children of Ammon and prevailed against them. And the children of Ammon gave him that same year one hundred talents of silver and ten thousand cors of wheat and ten thousand of barley. This much did the children of Ammon pay him also in the second and third years.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> So Jotham became strong, because he ordered his ways before Jehovah his God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And the rest of the acts of Jotham and all his wars and his ways are there written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David. And Ahaz his son reigned in his place.<br><br>
