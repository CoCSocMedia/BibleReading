  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And Saul told Jonathan his son and all his servants to kill David. But Jonathan, Saul’s son, took great delight in David.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father is seeking to kill you. Now therefore be on guard in the morning, and stay in some secret place, and hide yourself.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And I will go out and stand by my father’s side in the field where you are. And I will speak about you to my father; and if I learn anything, I will tell you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> So Jonathan spoke well about David to Saul his father and said to him, May the king not sin against his servant David, because he has not sinned against you, and because his deeds have been very good for you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> For he risked his life when he struck down the Philistine, and Jehovah accomplished a great salvation for all Israel. You saw <i>it</i> and rejoiced. Why then will you sin against innocent blood by having David killed without cause?<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan; and Saul swore, As Jehovah lives, he shall not be put to death.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Then Jonathan called David, and Jonathan told him all these things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence as before.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And there was war again. And David went out and fought against the Philistines. And he struck them with a great slaughter, and they fled from before him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> Then there came an evil spirit from Jehovah upon Saul, and he sat in his house with his spear in his hand while David played <i>the lyre</i> by hand.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And Saul sought to strike David even to the wall with the spear, but he slipped away from Saul’s presence. And Saul struck the wall with his spear, but David fled and escaped that night.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> Then Saul sent messengers to David’s house to watch him and kill him in the morning. And Michal, David’s wife, told him, saying, If you do not save your life tonight, in the morning you will be killed.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> So Michal let David down through the window, and he went away and fled and escaped.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> Then Michal took the teraphim and laid <i>it</i> in the bed. And she put a net of goats’ hair on its head and covered <i>it</i> with clothing.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, Bring him up to me on his bed that I may kill him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And when the messengers went in, there was the teraphim in the bed with a net of goats’ hair on its head.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> Then Saul said to Michal, Why have you deceived me like this and let my enemy go so that he has slipped away? And Michal said to Saul, He said to me, Let me go; why should I kill you?<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> So David fled and slipped away and came to Samuel at Ramah, and he told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt at Naioth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> Then it was told Saul, saying, David is now at Naioth in Ramah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> So Saul sent messengers to seize David; and when they saw the company of prophets prophesying and Samuel standing <i>and</i> presiding over them, the Spirit of God came upon Saul’s messengers, and they also prophesied.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And it was told Saul, and he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. And Saul again sent messengers the third time, and they also prophesied.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> Then he himself went to Ramah. And he came to the great well that is in Secu; and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And someone said, They are now at Naioth in Ramah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> So he went there, toward Naioth in Ramah. And the Spirit of God came upon him as well, and he went on and prophesied until he came to Naioth in Ramah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> And he also stripped off his clothes and also prophesied before Samuel, and he lay naked all that day and all that night. Therefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?<br><br>
