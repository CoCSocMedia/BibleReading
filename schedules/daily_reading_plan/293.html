  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Do not be incensed because of evildoers; / Do not be envious of wrongdoers.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> For they soon wither like grass / And fade away like green herbage.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> Trust in Jehovah, and do good; / Dwell in the land, and feed on <i>His</i> faithfulness.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Delight yourself in Jehovah, / And He will give you the requests of your heart.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> Commit your way to Jehovah, / And trust in Him; and He will act.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And He will cause your righteousness to go forth like light, / And your justness like noonday.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Be still before Jehovah, and wait for Him; / Do not be incensed because of him who enjoys prosperity on his way, / Because of the man who performs <i>his</i> evil schemes.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> Cease from anger and forsake wrath; / Do not be incensed; it <i>leads</i> only to evil.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> For the evildoers will be cut off; / But those who wait on Jehovah, / They will inherit the land.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And in a little while longer there will be no wicked man; / Indeed, you will look diligently for his place, and he will not be <i>there.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> But the lowly will inherit the land / And delight themselves in the abundance of peace.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> The wicked man makes evil schemes against the righteous man / And gnashes his teeth at him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> The Lord will laugh at him, / For He sees that his day will come.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> The wicked have drawn out the sword / And bent their bow, / To cast the poor and the needy down, / To slaughter those who are upright in <i>their</i> way.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> Their sword will enter their own heart, / And their bows will be broken.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> Better is the little that the righteous man has / Than the abundance of many wicked.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> For the arms of the wicked will be broken, / But Jehovah upholds the righteous.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> Jehovah knows the days of the perfect, / And their inheritance will be forever.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> They will not be put to shame in a time of evil, / And in the days of famine they will be satisfied.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> But the wicked will perish, / And the enemies of Jehovah will be like the glory of the pastures: / They are consumed; in smoke they are consumed.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> The wicked borrow but do not repay, / But the righteous is gracious and gives.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> For those blessed by Him will inherit the land, / But those cursed by Him will be cut off.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> A man’s steps are established by Jehovah, / And He delights in his way.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> If he falls, he is not utterly cast down; / For Jehovah upholds him by the hand.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> I was <i>once</i> a young man; now I am old. / Yet I have not seen the righteous man forsaken, / Nor his seed seeking bread.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> He is always gracious and lends, / And his seed becomes a blessing.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> Turn away from evil and do good, / And abide forever.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> For Jehovah loves justice / And does not abandon His faithful ones; / They are kept forever; / But the seed of the wicked is cut off.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> The righteous will inherit the land, / And they will abide in it forever.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom, / And his tongue speaks justice.<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> The law of his God is in his heart; / His steps do not slip.<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> The wicked man watches for the righteous man / And seeks to slay him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> Jehovah does not leave him in his hand, / Nor let him be condemned when he is judged.<br><br>
     <sup><b>34</b></sup> Wait for Jehovah, / And keep His way; / And He will exalt you to inherit the land; / When the wicked are cut off, you will see <i>it.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>35</b></sup> I have seen the wicked man terrorizing, / And spreading himself like a luxuriant native tree.<br><br>
     <sup><b>36</b></sup> Then someone passes by, and behold, he is not there; / I search for him, and he is not found.<br><br>
     <sup><b>37</b></sup> Observe the perfect man, and watch the upright man; / For there is a future for the man of peace.<br><br>
     <sup><b>38</b></sup> But the transgressors will be altogether destroyed; / The future of the wicked will be cut off.<br><br>
     <sup><b>39</b></sup> And the salvation of the righteous is from Jehovah; / He is their stronghold in a time of distress.<br><br>
     <sup><b>40</b></sup> And Jehovah helps them and rescues them; / He rescues them from the wicked, / And saves them, for they take refuge in Him.<br><br>
