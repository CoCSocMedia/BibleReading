  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Hear, O Jehovah, what is righteous; / Give heed to my cry; / Give ear to my prayer, / Which is not <i>made</i> with lips of deceit.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> May a judgment for me come forth from Your presence; / May Your eyes regard equity.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> You have examined my heart; You have visited me by night; / You have tried me: You have found nothing. / I have resolved that my mouth will not transgress.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Regarding the works of man, by the word of Your lips, / I have kept myself from the paths of the violent man.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> My steps have held fast to Your tracks; / My footsteps have not slipped.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> I call on You, for You will answer me, O God; / Incline Your ear to me; hear my speaking.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Wondrously display Your lovingkindness, / You who save by Your right hand / Those who take refuge <i>in You</i> from them who rise up against them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> Guard me like the pupil of <i>Your</i> eye; / In the shadow of Your wings hide me<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> From the presence of the wicked who oppress me, / <i>From</i> my deadly enemies, who close in upon me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> They have shut up their fat <i>hearts;</i> / With their mouths they speak arrogantly.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> Now they have surrounded us in our steps; / They have fixed their eyes on casting <i>us</i> down to the ground.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> He is like a lion that is eager to tear, / And like a young lion lurking in hidden places.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> Arise, O Jehovah, confront him; bring him down. / With Your sword rescue my soul from the wicked man,<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> From mortal men with Your hand, O Jehovah, / From mortal men of the world, whose portion is in this life, / And whose belly You fill with Your treasure; / They are satisfied with children, / And they leave their abundance for their little ones.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> As for me, in righteousness I will behold Your face; / When I awake, I will be satisfied with Your likeness.<br><br>
