  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Let God arise; let His enemies be scattered; / And let those who hate Him flee before Him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> As smoke is driven away, You will drive <i>them</i> away; / As wax melts before fire, / The wicked will perish before God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> But the righteous will rejoice; they will exult before God / And be glad with rejoicing.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Sing to God; sing psalms to His name; / Triumph in Him who rides through the deserts — / For Jah is His name — and exult before Him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> A Father to the orphans and a Judge for the widows / Is God in His holy habitation.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> God causes the solitary to dwell in a household; / He brings the prisoners forth into prosperity; / But the rebellious dwell in a parched land.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> O God, when You went forth before Your people, / When You marched through the desert, Selah<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> The earth trembled, the heavens also dripped, / At the presence of God; / Sinai there <i>quaked</i> / At the presence of God, the God of Israel.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> You shed forth bountiful rain, O God; / You confirmed Your inheritance when it languished.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> Your living <i>flock</i> dwelt in the land; / In Your goodness You provided for the poor, O God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> The Lord gives the command; / The women who bear the glad tidings are a great host.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> The kings of the armies flee. / They flee! / And she who abides at home / Divides the spoil.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> Though you lie among the sheepfolds, / There are dove wings covered with silver, / And its pinions, with greenish-yellow gold.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> When the Almighty scattered / The kings in the land, / It snowed on Zalmon.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> O mighty mountain, O mountain of Bashan, / O many-peaked mountain, O mountain of Bashan:<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> Why do you look with envy, O many-peaked mountains, / At the mountain on which God desires to dwell? / Indeed Jehovah will dwell <i>there</i> forever.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> The chariots of God are twenty thousand, / Thousands upon thousands; / The Lord is among them, / <i>As at</i> Sinai, in the sanctuary.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> You have ascended on high; You have led captive those taken captive; / You have received gifts among men, / Even the rebellious ones also, / That Jehovah God may dwell <i>among them.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> Blessed be the Lord, who day by day loads us <i>with</i> <i>good;</i> / God is our salvation. Selah<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> God is to us / A God of deliverance, / And with Jehovah the Lord / Are the goings forth <i>even</i> from death.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> Indeed God will smash / The head of His enemies, / The hairy crown / Of him who goes about in his guiltiness.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> The Lord said, I will bring <i>them</i> again from Bashan; / I will bring <i>them</i> again from the depths of the sea,<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> That you may bathe your foot in blood, / That the tongue of your dogs may have their portion from the enemies.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> They have seen Your goings, O God, / The goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary:<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> Singers go before; players after; / In the midst of virgins sounding the tambourines.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> Bless God in the congregations, / <i>Even</i> Jehovah, <i>O you who are</i> of the fountain of Israel.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> There are little Benjamin, who rules them, / <i>And</i> the princes of Judah <i>in</i> their company, / The princes of Zebulun, the princes of Naphtali.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> Your God has commanded your strength; / Strengthen, O God, that which You have done for us.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> Because of Your temple at Jerusalem, / Kings will bring a gift to You.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> Rebuke the animals of the reeds, / The herd of the bulls among the calves of the peoples, / Trampling on those who lust after silver; / Scatter the peoples who take delight in war.<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> Nobles will come out of Egypt; / Cush will quickly stretch out its hands to God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> O kingdoms of the earth, / Sing to God, / Sing psalms to the Lord, Selah<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> To Him who rides upon the ancient heaven of heavens. / Behold, He utters His voice, a mighty voice.<br><br>
     <sup><b>34</b></sup> Ascribe strength to God; / His excellence is over Israel, / And His strength is in the skies.<br><br>
     <sup><b>35</b></sup> <i>You are</i> awesome, O God, from Your sanctuaries. / The God of Israel, He gives strength and power to the people. / Blessed be God!<br><br>
