  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then Job again took up his discourse and said,<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Oh that I were as in the months of old, / As in the days when God watched over me;<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> When His lamp shone over my head, / <i>And</i> by His light I walked through darkness;<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> As I was in the days of my prime, / When intimate counsel with God was over my tent;<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> When the Almighty was yet with me, / <i>And</i> my children were around me;<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> When my steps were bathed in milk, / And the rock poured out for me streams of oil!<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> When I went out to the gate of the city, / When I prepared my seat in the square,<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> The young men saw me and hid themselves, / And the aged rose up <i>and</i> stood.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> Princes refrained from talking / And laid <i>their</i> hand over their mouth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> The voice of the nobles was hushed, / And their tongue stuck to the roof of their mouth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> For when the ear heard <i>me,</i> it blessed me; / And when the eye saw <i>me,</i> it bore witness to me;<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> Because I delivered the poor man who cried out, / And the orphan who had no one to help him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> The blessing of him who was perishing came upon me, / And I made the widow’s heart shout for joy.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; / My justice was like a robe and a turban.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> I was eyes to the blind, / And I was feet to the lame.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> I was a father to the needy, / And the cause of him whom I did not know I investigated.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> I broke the jaws of the unjust / And made him drop the prey from his teeth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> Then I said, I will die in my nest, / And I will multiply <i>my</i> days like the sand.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> My root is spread out to the water, / And dew abides on my branch at night.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> My glory is <i>always</i> new with me, / And my bow is renewed in my hand.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> <i>Men</i> listened to me and waited, / And they were silent for my counsel.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> After my words they spoke not again, / And my speech distilled <i>like</i> <i>dew</i> upon them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> And they waited for me as for the rain, / And they opened their mouth wide <i>as</i> for the late rain.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> I smiled on them — they could not believe <i>it;</i> / And they did not cast down the light of my countenance.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> I chose the way for them and sat as chief, / And I dwelt as a king among the troops, / As one who comforts those who mourn.<br><br>
