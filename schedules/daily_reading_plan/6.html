  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Now there was a man from the hill country of Ephraim whose name was Micah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And he said to his mother, The eleven hundred pieces of silver that were taken from you, about which you uttered a curse and spoke it in my hearing — look, the silver is with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed of Jehovah be my son!<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And he returned the eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother; and his mother said, I do consecrate the silver to Jehovah from my hand to my son to make a sculptured idol and a molten image. Now therefore I will return it to you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And when he returned the silver to his mother, his mother took two hundred pieces of silver and gave them to the founder, who made them into a sculptured idol and a molten image. And it was in the house of Micah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And the man Micah had a house of gods; and he made an ephod and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons to become his priest.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did that which was right in his own eyes.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And there was a young man from Bethlehem in Judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite; and he was a sojourner there.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And the man left the city Bethlehem in Judah to dwell wherever he could find <i>a place.</i> And he came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, as he made his way.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> And Micah said to him, Where do you come from? And he said to him, I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, and I am traveling in order to dwell wherever I can find <i>a place.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And Micah said to him, Stay with me, and be a father and a priest to me; and I will give you ten pieces of silver a year and an array of clothing and your food. So the Levite went <i>with him.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And the Levite was content to stay with the man; and the young man was to him like one of his sons.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his priest and was in the house of Micah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> Then Micah said, Now I know that Jehovah will prosper me, because the Levite has become my priest.<br><br>
