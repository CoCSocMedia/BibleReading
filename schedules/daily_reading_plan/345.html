  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> I will sing of the lovingkindness of Jehovah forever; / From generation to generation I will make known Your faithfulness with my mouth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> For I have said, Lovingkindness will be built up forever; / In the heavens themselves You will establish Your faithfulness.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> I have made a covenant with My chosen one; / I have sworn to David My servant:<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> I will establish your seed forever, / And I will build up your throne from generation to generation. Selah<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And the heavens will praise Your wonders, O Jehovah, / Indeed Your faithfulness in the congregation of the holy ones.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> For who in the skies can be compared to Jehovah? / <i>Who</i> among the sons of the mighty is like Jehovah,<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> <i>Like</i> God, greatly feared in the council of the holy ones / And awesome beyond all around Him?<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> O Jehovah God of hosts, who is like You, the mighty Jah? / Your faithfulness also surrounds You.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> You rule the swelling of the sea: / When its waves rise up, You still them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> You crushed Rahab like one slain; / You scattered Your enemies with the arm of Your strength.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> The heavens are Yours; the earth also is Yours; / The world and its fullness You have founded.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> You created the north and the south; / Tabor and Hermon shout for joy at Your name.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> You have an arm with might; / Your hand is strong; Your right hand is high.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne; / Lovingkindness and truth go before Your face.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> Blessed are the people who know the joyful shout; / They walk, O Jehovah, in the light of Your countenance.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> In Your name they exult all day long, / And in Your righteousness they are exalted.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> For You are the glory of their strength, / And in Your favor our horn is exalted.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> For our shield belongs to Jehovah, / And our king, to the Holy One of Israel.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> Then You spoke in vision / Of Your Holy One, and You said, / I have given help to One who is mighty; / I have exalted One chosen from My people.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> I have found David My Servant; / With My holy oil I have anointed Him,<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> With whom My hand will be established; / My arm will also strengthen Him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> The enemy will not exact <i>anything</i> from Him, / Nor will the son of wickedness afflict Him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> And I will crush His adversaries before Him, / And I will strike those who hate Him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> And My faithfulness and My lovingkindness will be with Him, / And in My name His horn will be exalted.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> And I will set His hand on the sea / And His right hand on the rivers.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> He will call upon Me, <i>saying,</i> You are My Father, / My God and the rock of My salvation.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> I will also make Him the Firstborn, / The highest of the kings of the earth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> I will keep My lovingkindness for Him forever, / And My covenant will stand firm with Him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> And I will establish His seed forever, / And His throne as the days of heaven.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> If His children forsake My law / And do not walk in My ordinances,<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> If they profane My statutes / And do not keep My commandments,<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> I will punish their transgression with a rod / And their iniquity with stripes.<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> But My lovingkindness I will not utterly take away from Him, / Nor will I be false to My own faithfulness.<br><br>
     <sup><b>34</b></sup> I will not profane My covenant, / Nor will I change what has gone forth from My lips.<br><br>
     <sup><b>35</b></sup> Once I have sworn by My holiness; / I will not lie to David.<br><br>
     <sup><b>36</b></sup> His seed shall endure forever, / And His throne, like the sun before Me;<br><br>
     <sup><b>37</b></sup> It shall be established forever like the moon; / And the witness in the skies is firm. Selah<br><br>
     <sup><b>38</b></sup> But You have cast off and rejected; / You have been angry with Your anointed.<br><br>
     <sup><b>39</b></sup> You have abhorred the covenant of Your servant; / You have profaned his crown <i>by casting it</i> to the ground.<br><br>
     <sup><b>40</b></sup> You have broken down all his walls; / You have brought his strongholds to ruin.<br><br>
     <sup><b>41</b></sup> All who pass by on the way plunder him; / He has become a reproach to his neighbors.<br><br>
     <sup><b>42</b></sup> You have exalted the right hand of his adversaries; / You have caused all his enemies to rejoice.<br><br>
     <sup><b>43</b></sup> Indeed You have turned back the edge of his sword / And have not made him stand in the battle.<br><br>
     <sup><b>44</b></sup> You have made his brightness cease / And have cast down his throne to the ground.<br><br>
     <sup><b>45</b></sup> You have shortened the days of his youth; / You have covered him with shame. Selah<br><br>
     <sup><b>46</b></sup> How long, O Jehovah? Will You hide Yourself forever? / <i>How long</i> will Your wrath burn like fire?<br><br>
     <sup><b>47</b></sup> Remember how short my time is — / For what vanity You have created all the sons of men!<br><br>
     <sup><b>48</b></sup> What man will live and not see death? / Will he deliver his soul from the power of Sheol? Selah<br><br>
     <sup><b>49</b></sup> Where are Your former acts of lovingkindness, O Lord, / Which You swore to David in Your faithfulness?<br><br>
     <sup><b>50</b></sup> Remember, O Lord, the reproach of Your servants, / How I bear in my bosom <i>the reproach of</i> all the mighty peoples,<br><br>
     <sup><b>51</b></sup> With which Your enemies have reproached, O Jehovah, / With which they have reproached the footsteps of Your anointed.<br><br>
     <sup><b>52</b></sup> Blessed be Jehovah forever. / Amen and Amen.<br><br>
