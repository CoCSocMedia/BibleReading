     <sup><b>36</b></sup> As well as the firstborn of our sons and of our cattle, as it is written in the law; and in order to bring the firstlings of our herds and of our flocks to the house of our God, to the priests who minister in the house of our God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>37</b></sup> We will also bring the first of our dough and our heave offerings and <i>of</i> the fruit of every tree <i>and</i> the new wine and the fresh oil to the priests at the chambers of the house of our God, and the tithe of our land to the Levites; for they, the Levites, are those who receive the tithes in all our rural towns.<br><br>
     <sup><b>38</b></sup> And the priest, the son of Aaron, shall be with the Levites when the Levites receive the tithes; and the Levites shall bring the tithe of the tithes up to the house of our God, to the chambers of the storehouse.<br><br>
     <sup><b>39</b></sup> For the children of Israel and the sons of Levi shall bring the heave offering of the grain, of the new wine, and of the fresh oil to the chambers, where the vessels of the sanctuary, the priests who minister, and the gatekeepers and the singers are; and we will not forsake the house of our God.<br><br>
