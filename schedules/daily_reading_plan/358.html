  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> O Jehovah, hear my prayer; / And let my cry come unto You.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Do not hide Your face from me / On the day of my distress; / Incline Your ear to me; / On the day when I call out, answer me quickly.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> For my days are consumed in smoke, / And my bones burn like a hearth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> My heart is stricken like grass and dried up; / Indeed I have <i>even</i> forgotten to eat my bread.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> Because of the voice of my groaning / My bones cling to my flesh.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> I am like a pelican of the wilderness; / I have become like an owl of the desolate places.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> I watch, and I am like / A lone sparrow on a housetop.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> All day long my enemies reproach me; / Those who deride me use me as a curse.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> For I have eaten ashes like bread, / And have mixed my drink with weeping,<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> Because of Your indignation and Your wrath; / For You have taken me up and cast me away.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> My days are like a shadow that declines, / And I am dried up like grass.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> But You, O Jehovah, abide forever; / And Your memorial is from generation to generation.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> You will arise <i>and</i> have compassion on Zion, / For it is time to be gracious to her; the appointed time has come.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> For Your servants take pleasure in her stones, / And show favor to her dust.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And the nations will fear the name of Jehovah, / And all the kings of the earth, Your glory;<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> For Jehovah has built up Zion; / He has appeared in His glory.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> He has regarded the prayer of the destitute, / And has not despised their prayer.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> This will be written for a generation to come, / And a people to be created will praise Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> For He has looked down from the height of His sanctuary; / From heaven Jehovah beheld the earth,<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> To hear the groaning of the prisoner, / To release those appointed to die;<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> That the name of Jehovah may be declared in Zion, / And His praise, in Jerusalem,<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> When the peoples are gathered together, / And the kingdoms, to serve Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> He has weakened my strength in the way; / He has shortened my days.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> I said, My God, / Do not take me away in the middle of my days; / Your years are throughout all generations.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> Of old You laid the foundation of the earth, / And the heavens are the work of Your hands.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> They will perish, but You endure; / Indeed all of them will wear out like a garment; / Like clothing You will change them, / And they will be changed.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> But You are the same, / And Your years are without end.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> The children of Your servants will continue, / And their seed will be established before You.<br><br>
