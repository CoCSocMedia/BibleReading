  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> I love You, O Jehovah, my strength.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Jehovah is my crag and my fortress and my Deliverer; / My God, my rock, in whom I take refuge; / My shield and the horn of my salvation, my high retreat.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> I called upon Jehovah, who is worthy of praise, And from my enemies I was saved.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> The cords of death encompassed me; / And the torrents of destruction assailed me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> The cords of Sheol surrounded me; / The snares of death confronted me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> In my distress I called upon Jehovah / And cried out to my God. / He heard my voice from His temple, / And my cry before Him came to His ears.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Then the earth shook and quaked, / And the foundations of the mountains trembled and shook about, / For He was furious.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> Smoke went up from His nostrils, / And fire from His mouth devoured; / Coals blazed forth from Him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> He bowed the heavens and descended, / And deep darkness was under His feet.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> He rode upon a cherub and did fly; / He darted upon the wings of the wind.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> He made darkness His hiding place, His pavilion around Him: / Dark waterclouds, thick clouds of the skies.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> Out of the brightness before Him there broke through His clouds / Hail and fiery coals.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> Then Jehovah thundered in heaven, / And the Most High uttered His voice.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> And He sent forth His arrows and scattered my enemies; / And He shot forth lightning bolts and discomfited them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> The channels of the sea were seen, / And the foundations of the habitable land were laid bare / At Your rebuke, O Jehovah, / At the blast of the breath of Your nostrils.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> He reached forth from on high; He took me; / He drew me out of great waters.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> He delivered me from my strong enemy / And from those who hate me, for they were too mighty for me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> They confronted me in the day of my calamity, / But Jehovah became my support.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> He brought me forth to a place broad and free; / He rescued me, for He took delight in me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> Jehovah has recompensed me according to my righteousness; / According to the cleanness of my hands He has repaid me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> For I have kept the ways of Jehovah / And have not acted wickedly <i>by turning</i> away from my God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> For all His judgments were before me, / And I did not turn His statutes away from me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> I was perfect toward Him, / And I kept myself from my iniquity.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> Therefore Jehovah recompensed me according to my righteousness, / According to the cleanness of my hands in His sight.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> With the faithful You show Yourself faithful, / With a perfect man You show Yourself perfect,<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> With the pure You show Yourself pure, / And with the perverse You show Yourself contrary.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> For it is You who save the afflicted people, / But the haughty eyes You bring down;<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> For it is You who light my lamp; / Jehovah my God lights up my darkness;<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> For by You I can run up against a troop; / Indeed by my God I can leap over a wall.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> As for God — His way is perfect; / The word of Jehovah is tried. / He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> For who is God other than Jehovah, / And who is a rock but our God?<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> The God who girds me with strength / And makes my way perfect,<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> Who makes my feet like hinds’ <i>feet</i> / And sets me on my high places,<br><br>
     <sup><b>34</b></sup> Who teaches my hands to wage war / So that my arms may bend a bronze bow.<br><br>
     <sup><b>35</b></sup> And You have given me the shield of Your salvation, / And Your right hand supports me; / And Your condescending gentleness has made me great.<br><br>
     <sup><b>36</b></sup> You have broadened the places of my steps under me, / And my feet have not slipped.<br><br>
     <sup><b>37</b></sup> I pursued my enemies and overtook them, / And I did not turn back until they were consumed.<br><br>
     <sup><b>38</b></sup> I shattered them, so that they were not able to rise up; / They fell under my feet.<br><br>
     <sup><b>39</b></sup> And You girded me with strength for war; / You brought down under me those who rose up against me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>40</b></sup> You also made my enemies turn <i>their</i> back to me, / And I annihilated those who hated me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>41</b></sup> They cried out, but there was no one to save <i>them;</i> / <i>They cried out</i> to Jehovah, but He did not answer them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>42</b></sup> Then I beat them like dust before the wind; / Like the mud of the streets I pounded them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>43</b></sup> You rescued me from the strivings of the people; / You have made me the head of the nations; / A people whom I had not known serves me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>44</b></sup> At the <i>mere</i> hearing of a report, they obey me; / Foreigners come cringing to me;<br><br>
     <sup><b>45</b></sup> Foreigners are discouraged / And come quaking out of their fortresses.<br><br>
     <sup><b>46</b></sup> Jehovah lives; and blessed be my rock, / And exalted be the God of my salvation,<br><br>
     <sup><b>47</b></sup> The God who executes vengeance for me / And subdues peoples under me,<br><br>
     <sup><b>48</b></sup> Who rescues me from my enemies. / Indeed You exalted me above those who rise up against me; / From the violent man You delivered me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>49</b></sup> Therefore I give thanks to You among the nations, O Jehovah; / And I will sing psalms to Your name.<br><br>
     <sup><b>50</b></sup> <i>It is He</i> who magnifies salvation to His king / And executes lovingkindness to His anointed, / To David and to his seed forever.<br><br>
