  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Now in the days of Ahasuerus (this is the Ahasuerus who reigned from India to Ethiopia over one hundred twenty-seven provinces)<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> In those days when King Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Susa the capital,<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> In the third year of his reign, he held a banquet for all his princes and his servants. The army of Persia and Media, the nobles, and the princes of the provinces were before him<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> As he showed the glorious wealth of his kingdom and the splendor of his great majesty for many days, for one hundred eighty days.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And when these days were completed, the king held a banquet for seven days for all the people found in Susa the capital, both great and small, in the court of the garden of the king’s palace.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> There were white cotton curtains and blue hangings tied with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and marble pillars, as well as couches of gold and silver upon a pavement of porphyry, white marble, mother-of-pearl, and mosaics.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And drinks were served in vessels of gold, and the vessels were different <i>from one another;</i> and the royal wine was abundant, according to the king’s bounty.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And the drinking was, by commandment, without constraint; for so the king had ordered all the officials of his house to do as each man desired.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> Also Vashti the queen held a banquet for the women in the royal house that belonged to King Ahasuerus.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven eunuchs who served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the royal crown, in order to show her beauty to the peoples and the princes; for she was beautiful in appearance.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s command <i>given</i> through the king’s eunuchs; and the king became very angry, and his wrath burned within him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> Then the king said to the wise men, who knew the times (for such was the custom of the king toward all who knew law and justice;<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> And those next to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king’s face and sat first in the kingdom):<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> According to the law, what is to be done to Queen Vashti because she has not performed the command of King Ahasuerus <i>given</i> through the eunuchs?<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen has done wrong not only to the king but also to all the princes and all the peoples who are in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> For this deed of the queen will go out to all women, causing them to view their husbands contemptibly as they say, King Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought to his presence, but she did not come.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> And this day the princesses of Persia and Media who have heard of the queen’s deed will speak <i>likewise</i> to all the king’s princes, and contempt and wrath will abound.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> If it please the king, let a royal order go forth from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, so that it cannot be overruled, that Vashti come no more into the presence of King Ahasuerus and that the king give her royal estate to another who is better than she.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> And when the king’s decree which he will make is heard throughout all his kingdom, vast though it is, all women will give honor to their husbands, great and small.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And this word pleased the king and the princes, and the king did according to Memucan’s word.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> So he sent letters to all the king’s provinces, to each province in its own script and to each people in their own language, that every man should be master in his own house and speak in the language of his own people.<br><br>
