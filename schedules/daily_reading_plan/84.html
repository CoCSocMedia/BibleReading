  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And in the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam the son of Nebat, Abijam began to reign over Judah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> He reigned three years in Jerusalem, and his mother’s name was Maacah, the daughter of Abishalom.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him; and his heart was not perfect with Jehovah his God like the heart of David his father.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Yet for David’s sake Jehovah his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem, raising up his son after him and establishing Jerusalem;<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> Because David did what was upright in the sight of Jehovah and did not turn aside from anything that He had commanded him all the days of his life, except in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And the rest of the acts of Abijam and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And Abijam slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David. And Asa his son reigned in his place.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam the king of Israel, Asa began to reign as king in Judah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And he reigned forty-one years in Jerusalem, and his mother’s name was Maacah, the daughter of Abishalom.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And Asa did what was upright in the sight of Jehovah, as David his father <i>had done.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And he put away the male cult prostitutes out of the land and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> And he also removed Maacah his mother from being queen mother because she had made an abominable image for Asherah. And Asa cut down her abominable image and burned <i>it</i> at the brook Kidron.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> But the high places were not removed; otherwise the heart of Asa was perfect with Jehovah all his days.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And he brought into the house of Jehovah the things his father had sanctified and the things he sanctified, silver and gold and vessels.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And there was war between Asa and Baasha the king of Israel all their days.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> And Baasha the king of Israel went up against Judah; and he built Ramah to prevent anyone from going out or coming in to Asa the king of Judah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> And Asa took all the silver and gold that was left among the treasures of the house of Jehovah as well as the treasures of the king’s house, and gave them into the hands of his servants. And King Asa sent them forth to Ben-hadad the son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, the king of Syria, who dwelt in Damascus, saying,<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> There is an alliance between me and you, between my father and your father. I am now sending you a present of silver and gold; go <i>and</i> break your alliance with Baasha the king of Israel, so that he goes away from me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> And Ben-hadad listened to King Asa and sent the captains of forces that he had against the cities of Israel, and he struck Ijon and Dan and Abel-beth-maacah and all Chinneroth with all the land of Naphtali.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And when Baasha heard <i>this,</i> he stopped building Ramah and dwelt in Tirzah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> Then King Asa made a proclamation to all Judah; no one was exempt. And they carried away the stones of Ramah and its timber, with which Baasha had built <i>it;</i> and King Asa built with these Geba of Benjamin and Mizpah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> And the rest of all the acts of Asa and all his might and all that he did and the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? Yet in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> And Asa slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father. And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa the king of Judah, and he reigned over Israel two years.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> And he did what was evil in the sight of Jehovah and walked in the way of his father and in his sin by which he caused Israel to sin.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha struck him down in Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines, while Nadab and all Israel were laying siege to Gibbethon.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> And Baasha killed him in the third year of Asa the king of Judah, and he reigned in his place.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> And as soon as he became king, he struck down all the house of Jeroboam; he left to Jeroboam not one who had breath, until he had destroyed them, according to the word of Jehovah, which He spoke through His servant Ahijah the Shilonite,<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> Because of the sins of Jeroboam, which he committed and by which he caused Israel to sin, because of his provocation by which he provoked Jehovah the God of Israel to anger.<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> And the rest of the acts of Nadab and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> And there was war between Asa and Baasha the king of Israel all their days.<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> In the third year of Asa the king of Judah, Baasha the son of Ahijah began to reign over all Israel in Tirzah for twenty-four years.<br><br>
     <sup><b>34</b></sup> And he did what was evil in the sight of Jehovah and walked in the way of Jeroboam and in his sin by which he caused Israel to sin.<br><br>
