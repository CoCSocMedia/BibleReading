  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> If one attempts a word with you, will you be wearied <i>by it?</i> / But who can refrain from speaking?<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> Indeed, you have instructed many, / And you have strengthened the weak hands.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Your words have raised up him who was stumbling, / And you have made the bowing knees firm.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> But now it comes to you, and you are wearied <i>by it;</i> / It touches you, and you are disturbed.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> Is not your fear <i>of God</i> your confidence, / And the integrity of your ways your hope?<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Remember now, who, being innocent, has <i>ever</i> perished? / And where have the upright <i>ever</i> been cut off?<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> According to what I have seen, those who plow iniquity / And those who sow trouble reap the same.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> By the breath of God they perish, / And by the blast of His anger they are consumed.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> The roaring of the lion and the sound of the fierce lion / And the teeth of the young lions are broken;<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> The strong lion perishes for lack of prey, / And the whelps of the lioness are scattered.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> But a matter has stolen in unto me, / And my ear has received a whisper of it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> In perplexing thoughts of the night visions, / When deep sleep falls upon men,<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> Dread came upon me, and trembling, / And caused all my bones to dread.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And a spirit passed before my face; / The hair of my flesh bristled.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> It stood still, but I could not discern its appearance; / A form <i>stood</i> before my eyes; / I heard a murmur of a voice:<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> Can a mortal man be more righteous than God? / Can a man be purer than his Maker?<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> If He puts no trust in His servants, / And He charges His angels with error,<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> How much more those who dwell in houses of clay, / Whose foundation is in dust, / Who are crushed like a moth!<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> From morning to evening they are smashed to pieces; / Without any considering <i>it,</i> they continually perish.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> Should their tent cord be plucked up within them, / They die, and not in wisdom.<br><br>
