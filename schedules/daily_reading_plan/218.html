  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Tell the children of Israel to take for Me a heave offering. From every man whose heart makes him willing you shall take My heave offering.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And this is the heave offering which you shall take from them: gold and silver and bronze,<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And blue and purple and scarlet <i>strands,</i> and fine linen, and goats’ <i>hair,</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And rams’ skins dyed red, and porpoise skins, and acacia wood,<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> Oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense,<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Onyx stones and stones to be set for the ephod and for the breastplate.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And let them make a sanctuary for Me that I may dwell in their midst;<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> According to all that I show you, the pattern of the tabernacle and the pattern of all its furnishings, even so shall you make <i>it.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And they shall make an ark of acacia wood: two and a half cubits shall be its length; and one and a half cubits, its width; and one and a half cubits, its height.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And you shall overlay it with pure gold; inside and outside you shall overlay it; and you shall make a rim of gold upon it all around.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And you shall cast four rings of gold for it, and put <i>them</i> on its four feet; and two rings shall be on one side of it, and two rings on the other side of it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> And you shall make poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> And you shall put the poles into the rings on the sides of the Ark to carry the Ark with them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> The poles shall be in the rings of the Ark; they shall not be taken from it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And you shall put into the Ark the Testimony which I will give you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> And you shall make an expiation cover of pure gold: two and a half cubits shall be its length, and one and a half cubits, its width.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> And you shall make two cherubim of gold; of beaten work you shall make them, at the two ends of the expiation cover.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> And make one cherub at one end and one cherub at the other end; of <i>one piece with</i> the expiation cover you shall make the cherubim on its two ends.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> And the cherubim shall spread out their wings above <i>the cover,</i> covering the expiation cover with their wings, with their faces toward one another; the faces of the cherubim shall be toward the expiation cover.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And you shall put the expiation cover upon the Ark above <i>it,</i> and into the Ark you shall put the Testimony that I will give you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> And there I will meet with you, and I will speak with you from above the expiation cover, from between the two cherubim which are upon the Ark of the Testimony, of everything which I will give you in commandment to the children of Israel.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> And you shall make a table of acacia wood: two cubits shall be its length, and a cubit its width, and one and a half cubits its height.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> And you shall overlay it with pure gold and make a rim of gold around it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> And you shall make a frame of a handbreadth around it; and you shall make a rim of gold for its frame around <i>it.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> And you shall make for it four rings of gold and put the rings on the four corners that are on its four feet.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> The rings shall be close to the frame as holders for the poles to carry the table.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> And you shall make the poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold, and the table shall be carried with them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> And you shall make its plates and its cups and its pitchers and its bowls with which to pour out <i>drink offerings;</i> of pure gold you shall make them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> And you shall set the bread of the Presence upon the table before Me always.<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> And you shall make a lampstand of pure gold. The lampstand <i>with</i> its base and its shaft shall be made of beaten work; its cups, its calyxes, and its blossom buds shall be of <i>one piece with</i> it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> And there shall be six branches going out of its sides; three branches of the lampstand out of one of its sides, and three branches of the lampstand out of its other side;<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> Three cups made like almond <i>blossoms</i> in one branch, a calyx and a blossom bud; and three cups made like almond <i>blossoms</i> in the other branch, a calyx and a blossom bud — so for the six branches going out of the lampstand.<br><br>
     <sup><b>34</b></sup> And <i>there shall be</i> on the lampstand four cups made like almond <i>blossoms,</i> its calyxes and its blossom buds;<br><br>
     <sup><b>35</b></sup> And a calyx under two branches of <i>one piece with</i> it, and a calyx under two branches of <i>one piece with</i> it, and a calyx under two branches of <i>one piece with</i> it, for the six branches going out of the lampstand.<br><br>
     <sup><b>36</b></sup> Their calyxes and their branches shall be of <i>one piece with</i> it; all of it one beaten work of pure gold.<br><br>
     <sup><b>37</b></sup> And you shall make its lamps, seven; and set up its lamps to give light to the area in front of it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>38</b></sup> And its tongs and its firepans shall be of pure gold.<br><br>
     <sup><b>39</b></sup> It shall be made of a talent of pure gold, with all these utensils.<br><br>
     <sup><b>40</b></sup> And see that you make <i>them</i> according to their pattern, which was shown to you in the mountain.<br><br>
