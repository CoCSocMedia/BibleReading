  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Give thanks to Jehovah, for He is good, / For His lovingkindness is forever.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Let Israel say, / His lovingkindness is forever.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> Let the house of Aaron say, / His lovingkindness is forever.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Let those who fear Jehovah say, / His lovingkindness is forever.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> Out of my distress I called upon Jehovah; / Jehovah answered me <i>and set me</i> in a place broad and free.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> Jehovah is for me; I will not be afraid. / What can man do to me?<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Jehovah is for me as my Helper, / And I will see <i>what should happen</i> to those who hate me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> It is better to take refuge in Jehovah / Than to trust in man.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> It is better to take refuge in Jehovah / Than to trust in princes.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> All nations surrounded me; / In the name of Jehovah I indeed cut them down!<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> They surrounded me; yes, they surrounded me; / In the name of Jehovah I indeed cut them down!<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> They surrounded me like bees; / They were extinguished like a fire of thorns; / In the name of Jehovah I indeed cut them down!<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> I was pushed hard that I might fall; / But Jehovah helped me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> Jehovah is my strength and my song, / And He has become my salvation.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> The voice of rejoicing and salvation / Is in the tents of the righteous. / The right hand of Jehovah does valiantly;<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> The right hand of Jehovah is exalted; / The right hand of Jehovah does valiantly.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> I will not die, but live, / And declare the works of Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> Jehovah has severely chastened me, / But He has not given me over to death.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> Open to me the gates of righteousness: / I will enter in through them; I will give thanks to Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> This is the gate of Jehovah; / The righteous shall enter in through it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> I will give thanks to You, for You have answered me / And have become my salvation.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> The stone which the builders rejected / Has become the head of the corner.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> This is from Jehovah; / It is wonderful in our sight.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> This is the day that Jehovah has made; / Let us exult and rejoice in it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> O Jehovah, do save, we pray! / O Jehovah, do send prosperity, we pray!<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> Blessed is He who comes in the name of Jehovah; / We bless you from the house of Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> Jehovah is God, / And He has given us light; / Bind the sacrifice of the feast with cords / To the horns of the altar.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> You are my God, and I give thanks to You. / <i>You are</i> my God; I will exalt You.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> Give thanks to Jehovah, for He is good, / For His lovingkindness is forever.<br><br>
