  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Can a man of might be of any use to God? / No, a man of insight is of use only to himself.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> Is it a matter of delight to the Almighty that you are righteous? / Or is it a gain <i>to Him</i> that you make your ways perfect?<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Is it because of your fear <i>of Him</i> that He reproves you, / That He enters into judgment with you?<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> Is not your wickedness great, / And is there no end to your iniquities?<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> For you have taken pledges from your brothers without cause / And stripped the naked of their clothing.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> You have not given water to the weary to drink, / And you have withheld bread from the hungry.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And as for the man of power, the earth was his; / And the man of honor dwelt in it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> You have sent away the widows empty, / And the arms of the orphans have been crushed.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> Therefore snares are all around you; / And sudden dread troubles you,<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> Or darkness, so that you cannot see; / And an abundance of waters covers you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> Is not God at the height of heaven? / And look at the highest of the stars, how lofty they are!<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> And you say, What does God know? / Can He judge through the deep darkness?<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> Thick clouds are a covering to Him, so He cannot see; / And He walks upon the circle of the heavens.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> Will you keep the old way, / Which wicked men have trodden?<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> Such were snatched away before their time, / Whose foundation was poured forth like a stream;<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> Who said to God, Depart from us; / And, What can the Almighty accomplish for us?<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> Yet He fills their houses with good things. / But the counsel of the wicked is far from Him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> The righteous see and rejoice, / And the innocent deride them,<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> <i>Saying,</i> Surely those who rose up against us are cut off, / And the remnant of them the fire has devoured.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> Be well disposed to Him and at peace <i>with Him;</i> / By such, good will come upon you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> Receive instruction from His mouth, / And lay up His words in your heart.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> If you return to the Almighty, you will be built up. / If you put injustice far away from your tents,<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> And place <i>your</i> gold nuggets in the dust / And <i>your gold of</i> Ophir in the stones of the brooks,<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> Then the Almighty will be your gold nuggets / And precious silver to you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> For then you will delight yourself in the Almighty, / And you will lift up your countenance to God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> You will pray to Him, and He will hear you; / And you will repay your vows.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> You will also decree something, and it will be established for you; / And light will shine on your ways.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> When they cast you down, you will say, <i>I am</i> up! / And the lowly person He will save.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> He will deliver him who is not innocent; / Yes, you will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands.<br><br>
