  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Call now! Is there anyone who will answer you? / And to which of the holy ones will you turn?<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Surely vexation slays the fool, / And jealousy kills the simpleton.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> I have seen the fool taking root, / But suddenly I cursed his habitation.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> His children are far from safety, / And they are crushed in the gate; and there is no one to deliver <i>them.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> The hungry eat his harvest / And even take <i>it</i> out from the thorns, / And the thirsty pant after his wealth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> For evil does not come forth from the dust, / Nor does trouble spring forth from the ground.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> But man is born unto trouble, / Just as sparks fly upward.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> But as for me, I would seek after God, / And I would commit my cause to God,<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> Who does great things that cannot be searched, / Wonderful deeds that cannot be numbered;<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> Who gives rain upon the surface of the earth / And sends water upon the surface of the fields;<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> Who sets on high those who are lowly / And puts those who mourn safely above <i>all.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> He frustrates the devices of the crafty, / So that their hands achieve no enterprise.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> He seizes the wise in their own craftiness, / And the counsel of the wily is brought to a sudden end.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> By day they encounter darkness, / And at noon they grope about as in the night.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> But He saves the needy from the sword of their mouth, / From the hand of the strong.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> Thus the poor have hope, / And Injustice stops her mouth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> Indeed, blessed is the man whom God corrects; / Therefore do not reject the chastening of the Almighty.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> For He wounds, but He binds up; / He strikes, but His hands heal.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> In six troubles He will deliver you; / Indeed in seven no evil will touch you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> In famine He will redeem you from death, / And in battle, from the power of the sword.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> From the scourge of the tongue you will be hidden, / And you will not be afraid of destruction when it comes.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> At destruction and at famine you will laugh, / And you will not be afraid of the animals of the earth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> For you will be in an alliance with the stones of the field, / And the animals of the field will be at peace with you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> And you will know that your tent is at peace, / And you will inspect your fold and miss nothing.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> And you will know that your seed will be great, / And your offspring like the grass of the earth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> You will come to the grave at a ripe old age, / Like a shock of grain coming up in its season.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> This is it. We have searched it out; it is so. / Hear then and know it for yourself.<br><br>
