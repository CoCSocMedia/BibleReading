  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And when the wall was built and I had set up the doors, and the gatekeepers and the singers and Levites had been appointed,<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> I gave my brother Hanani, as well as Hananiah the commander of the citadel, charge over Jerusalem, for he was a faithful man and feared God more than most.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And I said to them, Do not let the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun is hot; and while some are standing <i>guard,</i> let them shut the doors, and you bar <i>them;</i> and appoint watches from the inhabitants of Jerusalem, each at his own watch and each opposite his own house.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Now the city was wide and large; but the people were few in it and no houses had been built.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> Then my God put it into my heart to assemble the nobles and the rulers and the people to be enrolled by genealogy. And I found the book of the genealogy of those who had first come up, and I found <i>this</i> written in it:<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> These are the children of the province who went up out of the captivity of those who had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away and who returned to Jerusalem and to Judah, each man to his city;<br><br>

     <sup><b>60</b></sup> All the temple servants and the children of Solomon’s servants were three hundred ninety-two.<br><br>
     <sup><b>61</b></sup> And these were those who went up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer; but they could not give evidence of their fathers’ houses nor their descendants, whether they were of Israel:<br><br>
     <sup><b>62</b></sup> The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred forty-two.<br><br>

     <sup><b>64</b></sup> These sought their registry among those who were enrolled by genealogy, but they were not found; therefore they were considered defiled <i>and were excluded</i> from the priesthood.<br><br>
     <sup><b>65</b></sup> And the governor told them that they should not eat of the most holy things until a priest stood up with Urim and Thummim.<br><br>

     <sup><b>70</b></sup> And some from among the heads of fathers’ <i>houses</i> gave to the work. The governor gave to the treasury one thousand darics of gold, fifty basins, <i>and</i> five hundred thirty priests’ garments.<br><br>
     <sup><b>71</b></sup> And some of the heads of fathers’ <i>houses</i> gave into the treasury of the work twenty thousand darics of gold and two thousand two hundred minas of silver.<br><br>
     <sup><b>72</b></sup> And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand darics of gold and two thousand minas of silver and sixty-seven priests’ garments.<br><br>
