  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> The sons of Judah: Perez, Hezron, and Carmi, and Hur and Shobal.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And Reaiah the son of Shobal begot Jahath; and Jahath begot Ahumai and Lahad. These are the families of the Zorathites.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And these were <i>the sons of</i> the father of Etam: Jezreel and Ishma and Idbash; and the name of their sister was Hazzelelponi;<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And Penuel the father of Gedor and Ezer the father of Hushah; these were the sons of Hur, the firstborn of Ephrathah, the father of Bethlehem.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And Ashhur the father of Tekoa had two wives, Helah and Naarah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And Naarah bore him Ahuzzam and Hepher and Temeni and Haahashtari; these were the sons of Naarah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And the sons of Helah: Zereth, Izhar, and Ethnan.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And Koz begot Anub and Zobebah and the families of Aharhel the son of Harum.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> And Jabez was held in more honor than his brothers; and his mother called his name Jabez, saying, Because I bore <i>him</i> with pain.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And Jabez called on the God of Israel saying, Oh that You would richly bless me and enlarge my border, and that Your hand would be with me, and that You would so keep me from evil that it would not grieve me! And God caused what he had requested to come to pass.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And Chelub the brother of Shuah begot Mehir, who was the father of Eshton.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And Eshton begot Bethrapha and Paseah and Tehinnah the father of Ir-nahash; these were the men of Recah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> And the sons of Kenaz: Othniel and Seraiah; and the son of Othniel: Hathath.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> And Meonothai begot Ophrah; and Seraiah begot Joab the father of Geharashim, for they were craftsmen.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And the sons of Caleb the son of Jephunneh: Iru, Elah, and Naam; and the son of Elah: Kenaz.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And the sons of Jehallelel: Ziph and Ziphah, Tiria and Asareel.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> And the sons of Ezrah: Jether and Mered and Epher and Jalon; and <i>Bithiah</i> conceived <i>and bore to Mered</i> Miriam and Shammai and Ishbah the father of Eshtemoa.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> (But his Judahite wife bore Jered the father of Gedor and Heber the father of Soco and Jekuthiel the father of Zanoah.) And these are the sons of Bithiah the daughter of Pharaoh, whom Mered took.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> And the sons of the wife of Hodiah, the sister of Naham: the father of Keilah the Garmite and Eshtemoa the Maacathite.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> And the sons of Shimon: Amnon and Rinnah, Ben-hanan and Tilon. And the sons of Ishi: Zoheth and Ben-zoheth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> The sons of Shelah the son of Judah: Er the father of Lecah and Laadah the father of Mareshah and the families of the house of those who worked with fine linen at Beth-ashbea<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> And Jokim and the men of Cozeba and Joash and Saraph, who ruled over Moab, and Jashubi-lehem. (But the records are ancient.)<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> These were the potters and the inhabitants of Netaim and Gedarah; they dwelt there with the king for his work.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> The sons of Simeon: Nemuel and Jamin, Jarib, Zerah, Shaul;<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> Shallum his son, Mibsam his son, Mishma his son.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> And the sons of Mishma: Hammuel his son, Zaccur his son, Shimei his son;<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> And Shimei had sixteen sons and six daughters, but his brothers did not have many sons; neither did all their family multiply like the sons of Judah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> And they dwelt at Beer-sheba and Moladah and Hazar-shual,<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> And at Bilhah and at Ezem and at Tolad<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> And at Bethuel and at Hormah and at Ziklag<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> And at Beth-marcaboth and at Hazar-susim and at Beth-biri and at Shaaraim. These were their cities until the reign of David.<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> And their villages were Etam and Ain, Rimmon and Tochen and Ashan, five cities;<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> As well as all their villages which were around these cities, as far as Baal. These were their dwelling places and their genealogical enrollment.<br><br>
     <sup><b>34</b></sup> And Meshobab and Jamlech and Joshah the son of Amaziah<br><br>
     <sup><b>35</b></sup> And Joel and Jehu the son of Joshibiah, the son of Seraiah, the son of Asiel,<br><br>
     <sup><b>36</b></sup> And Elioenai and Jaakobah and Jeshohaiah and Asaiah and Adiel and Jesimiel and Benaiah<br><br>
     <sup><b>37</b></sup> And Ziza the son of Shiphi, the son of Allon, the son of Jedaiah, the son of Shimri, the son of Shemaiah —<br><br>
     <sup><b>38</b></sup> These mentioned by name were leaders in their families; and their fathers’ houses increased greatly.<br><br>
     <sup><b>39</b></sup> And they went to the entrance of Gedor, as far as the east side of the valley, to seek pasture for their flocks.<br><br>
     <sup><b>40</b></sup> And they found rich and good pasture and a spacious and quiet and peaceful land, for they who had formerly dwelt there were of Ham.<br><br>
     <sup><b>41</b></sup> And these written by name came in the days of Hezekiah the king of Judah, and struck their tents and the Meunim who were found there, and destroyed them utterly, <i>as they are</i> to this day; and they have dwelt in place of them; for there was pasture there for their flocks.<br><br>
     <sup><b>42</b></sup> And some of them from among the sons of Simeon, five hundred men, went to Mount Seir, having at their head Pelatiah and Neariah and Rephaiah and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi;<br><br>
     <sup><b>43</b></sup> And they struck down the rest of the Amalekites who had escaped; and they have dwelt there to this day.<br><br>
