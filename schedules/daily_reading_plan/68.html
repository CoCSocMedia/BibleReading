  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Now these are the last words of David:The declaration of David the son of Jesse, / And the declaration of the man who has been raised up on high, / The anointed of the God of Jacob, / The one lovely in the psalms of Israel.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> The Spirit of Jehovah spoke through me, / And His word was on my tongue.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> The God of Israel spoke, / The Rock of Israel spoke to me, / Who rules among men righteously, / Who rules with the fear of God,<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And is like the light of the morning when the sun rises, / A morning without clouds, / <i>As when</i> the tender grass <i>sprouts up</i> from the earth / At the <i>sun’s</i> shining after a rain.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> For is not my house so with God? / For He has made an eternal covenant with me, / Ordered in all things and secure. / For all my salvation and all <i>my</i> desire, / Will He not indeed make them grow?<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> But the wicked, all of them, will be / Like thorns to be thrust away, / Because they cannot be taken with the hand.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> But the man who touches them / Must arm himself with an iron rod or with the shaft of a spear; / And they will be burned with fire in <i>their</i> place.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: Josheb-basshebeth a Tahchemonite; he was the chief of the captains; the same is Adino the Eznite, <i>who fought</i> against eight hundred, who were slain at one time.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> After him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the son of an Ahohite, <i>one</i> among the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines who were gathered there for battle, and the men of Israel went away.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> He rose up and struck the Philistines until his hand was weary; and his hand clung to the sword, and Jehovah accomplished a great salvation that day; and the people returned after him, but only to strip <i>the slain.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. Now the Philistines were gathered into a troop where there was a plot of land full of lentils, and the people fled before the Philistines.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> But he stationed himself in the midst of the plot and defended it and struck the Philistines, and Jehovah accomplished a great salvation.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> Now three of the thirty chief men went down and came to David at harvest time in the cave of Adullam; and the Philistine troop was encamped in the valley of Rephaim.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> Now at that time David was in the stronghold; and the garrison of the Philistines was at that time in Bethlehem.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And David said longingly, If only someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem that is by the gate!<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And the three mighty men burst through the camp of the Philistines and drew water from the well of Bethlehem that is by the gate. And they carried <i>it</i> and brought <i>it</i> to David, but he would not drink it; rather he poured it out to Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> And he said, Far be it from me, O Jehovah, that I should do this! <i>Shall I drink</i> the blood of the men who went at the risk of their lives? Therefore he would not drink it. These things the three mighty men did.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> And Abishai the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the three. And he brandished his spear against three hundred, <i>who were</i> slain; and he had a name among the three.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> He was indeed the most honored among the thirty, and he became their leader; but he did not attain to the three.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man from Kabzeel, was great in mighty deeds. He struck the two <i>sons</i> of Ariel the Moabite; he also went down and struck a lion in the midst of a pit on a snowy day.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And he struck an Egyptian, an imposing man. And the Egyptian had a spear in his hand, but he went down to him with a staff and snatched the spear out of the hand of the Egyptian and slew him with his own spear.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> These things Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did, and he had a name among the three mighty men.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> He was more honored than the thirty, but he did not attain to the three. And David set him over his bodyguard.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem;<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> Shammah the Harodite; Elika the Harodite;<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> Helez the Paltite; Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite;<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> Abiezer the Anathothite; Mebunnai the Hushathite;<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> Zalmon the Ahohite; Maharai the Netophathite;<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> Heleb the son of Baanah the Netophathite; Ittai the son of Ribai from Gibeah of the children of Benjamin;<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> Benaiah the Pirathonite; Hiddai from the brooks of Gaash;<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> Abi-albon the Arbathite; Azmaveth the Barhumite;<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> Eliahba the Shaalbonite; <i>of</i> the sons of Jashen, Jonathan;<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> Shammah the Hararite; Ahiam the son of Sharar the Ararite;<br><br>
     <sup><b>34</b></sup> Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai; the son of the Maachathite; Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite;<br><br>
     <sup><b>35</b></sup> Hezrai the Carmelite; Paarai the Arbite;<br><br>
     <sup><b>36</b></sup> Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah; Bani the Gadite;<br><br>
     <sup><b>37</b></sup> Zelek the Ammonite; Naharai the Beerothite, the armor bearer to Joab the son of Zeruiah;<br><br>
     <sup><b>38</b></sup> Ira the Ithrite; Gareb the Ithrite;<br><br>
     <sup><b>39</b></sup> Uriah the Hittite. <i>They were</i> thirty-seven in all.<br><br>
