  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then Job again took up his discourse and said,<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> As God lives, who has taken away my right, / And the Almighty, who has embittered my soul,<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> As long as my breath is in me / And the spirit of God is in my nostrils,<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Surely my lips will not speak anything wrong, / Nor will my tongue utter deceit.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> Far be it from me to declare you righteous! / Until I die, I will not put away my integrity from me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> To my righteousness I will hold fast, I will not let it go; / My heart does not reproach <i>me</i> for any of my days.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> May my enemy be like a wicked man, / And may he who rises up against me be like someone unjust.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> For what is the hope of the profane man when God cuts <i>him</i> off, / When He takes away his soul?<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> Will God hear his cry / When distress comes upon him?<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> Does he take delight in the Almighty? / Will he call upon God at all times?<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> I will teach you about the hand of God; / What is with the Almighty I will not conceal.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> Indeed, all of you have seen <i>it</i> yourselves; / And why then have you become altogether vain?<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> This is the portion with God for a wicked man, / And the inheritance that oppressors receive from the Almighty:<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> If his children are multiplied, it is for the sword; / And his offspring will not be satisfied with bread;<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> Those who remain of him will be buried in death, / And his widows will not lament.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> Though he heaps up silver like dust / And prepares garments like clay,<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> He may prepare <i>them,</i> but the righteous will wear <i>them;</i> / And the innocent will divide the silver.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> He builds his house as a moth does / And like a hut that a watchman makes.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> He lies down rich but <i>will be rich</i> no more; / He opens his eyes, and he is not.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> Terrors overtake him like waters; / At night a whirlwind steals him away.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> The east wind carries him off, and he goes; / And it sweeps him out of his place.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> And <i>God</i> hurls at him and does not spare; / He hastily flees from His hand.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> <i>Men</i> clap their hands at him / And hiss him out of his place.<br><br>
