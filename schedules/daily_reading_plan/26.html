  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And Samuel said to all Israel, I have now listened to your voice according to all that you have said to me, and I have placed a king over you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And now, here is the king who goes before you. But I am old and gray, and my sons are here with you, and I have gone before you from my youth until this day.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> Here I am; testify against me before Jehovah and before His anointed. Whose ox have I taken? Or whose donkey have I taken? Or whom have I defrauded? Whom have I oppressed? Or from whose hand have I taken a bribe in order to blind my eyes with it? Then I will restore <i>it</i> to you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And they said, You have not defrauded us or oppressed us or taken anything from anyone’s hand.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And he said to them, Jehovah is Witness against you, and His anointed is witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand. And they said, <i>He is</i> witness.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And Samuel said to the people, It is Jehovah who appointed Moses and Aaron and who brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Now therefore stand here, that I may plead with you before Jehovah concerning all the righteous acts of Jehovah, which He did to you and to your fathers.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> When Jacob went to Egypt, and your fathers cried out to Jehovah, Jehovah sent Moses and Aaron; and they brought your fathers out from Egypt and caused them to dwell in this place.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> But they forgot Jehovah their God, and He sold them into the hand of Sisera, the captain of Hazor’s army, and into the hand of the Philistines and into the hand of the king of Moab; and they fought against them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> Then they cried out to Jehovah and said, We have sinned, for we have forsaken Jehovah and have served the Baals and the Ashtaroth; but deliver us now from the hand of our enemies, and we will serve You.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And Jehovah sent Jerubbaal and Bedan and Jephthah and Samuel, and He delivered you from the hand of your enemies all around; and you dwelt securely.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And when you saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, you said to me, No; but a king will reign over us, though Jehovah your God was your King.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> Now therefore here is the king whom you have chosen <i>and</i> whom you have asked for. See then, Jehovah has set a king over you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> If you fear Jehovah and serve Him and listen to His voice and do not rebel against the commandment of Jehovah, and <i>if</i> both you and the king who reigns over you follow Jehovah your God, <i>fine.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> But if you do not listen to the voice of Jehovah, but rebel against the commandment of Jehovah, then the hand of Jehovah will be against you, as <i>it was</i> against your fathers.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> Now therefore stand here and see this great thing that Jehovah will do before your eyes.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> Is it not the wheat harvest today? I will call to Jehovah, that He send thunder and rain; and you will know and see that your wickedness which you have done in the sight of Jehovah by asking for a king for yourselves is great.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> And Samuel called to Jehovah, and Jehovah sent thunder and rain on that day. And all the people feared Jehovah and Samuel greatly.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> Then all the people said to Samuel, Pray to Jehovah your God for your servants that we would not die, for we have added to all our sins the evil of asking for a king for ourselves.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> And Samuel said to the people, Do not be afraid. You have done all this evil, yet do not turn away from following Jehovah, but serve Jehovah with all your heart.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And do not turn away, for <i>your turning away would be</i> after vain <i>idols,</i> which cannot profit or deliver <i>you,</i> for they are vanity.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> For because of His great name Jehovah will not forsake His people, for Jehovah has been pleased to make you a people for Himself.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> Moreover as for me, far be it from me that I would sin against Jehovah by ceasing to pray for you, but I will instruct you in the good and right way.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> Only, fear Jehovah and serve Him in truth with all your heart, for consider what great things He has done for you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> But if you still do wickedly, both you and your king will be consumed.<br><br>
