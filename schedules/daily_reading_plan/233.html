  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then Job answered and said,<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> How long will you grieve my soul / And crush me with <i>your</i> words?<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> These ten times you have reproached me; / You are not ashamed to deal wrongly with me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And be it that I have erred, / My error remains with me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> If you indeed magnify yourselves against me / And use my reproach in argument against me,<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> Know then that God has subverted my cause / And compassed me about with His net.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Indeed, I cry out, Violence! and I am not answered; / I call for help, and there is no justice.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> He has walled up my way so that I cannot pass; / And He has put darkness upon my paths.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> He has stripped my glory from me / And taken away the crown on my head.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> He has broken me all around, and I am gone; / And my hope is plucked up like a tree.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> He has also kindled His anger against me, / And in Himself He considers me as His adversary.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> His troops come together / And cast up their highway against me / And encamp all around my tent.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> He has removed my brothers far from me, / And those who know me are wholly estranged from me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> My relatives have failed <i>me,</i> / And my acquaintances have forgotten me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> Those who sojourn in my house and my maids consider me as a stranger; / I am a foreigner in their eyes.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> To my servant I call out, but he does not answer; / I entreat him with my mouth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> My breath is strange to my wife; / And my supplications, to the children of my <i>mother’s</i> womb.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> Even little children despise me: / I arise and they speak against me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> All the men whom I take counsel with abhor me, / And those whom I love have turned against me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> My bones cleave to my skin and to my flesh, / And I have escaped by the skin of my teeth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> Pity me, pity me, O my friends; / For the hand of God has touched me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> Why do you persecute me as God does / And are not satisfied with <i>eating</i> my flesh?<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> Oh, that my words were now written! / Oh, that they were inscribed in a book!<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> That with an iron pen and with lead / They were engraved in rock forever!<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> But I know that my Redeemer lives, / And at the last He will stand upon the earth;<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> And after this body of mine is destroyed, / Outside my flesh I will look on God,<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> Whom I, even I, will look on for myself, / And my eyes will see; <i>I,</i> and no other. / My inward parts that long for <i>God</i> are consumed within me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> If you say, How will we persecute him? / For the root of the matter is found in him;<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> Be fearful of the sword, / For wrath <i>brings</i> the punishment of the sword, / That you may know that there is a judgment.<br><br>
