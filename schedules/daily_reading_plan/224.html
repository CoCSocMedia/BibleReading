  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> My soul loathes my own life; / I will let my complaint have free course in me; / I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> I will say to God, Do not account me wicked; / Make known to me why You contend with me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> Does it <i>seem</i> good to You to oppress, / To despise the toil of Your hands / And shine upon the counsel of the wicked?<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Do You have eyes of flesh? / Or do You see as a man sees?<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> Are Your days like the days of a man, / Or Your years like the days of a mighty man,<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> That You would seek out my iniquity / And search for my sin,<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Even though You know that I am not wicked / And that there is none who can deliver out of Your hand?<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> Your hands have shaped me and made me altogether, / Yet You destroy me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> Remember now that You have made me like clay; / And will You return me to the dust?<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> Have You not poured me out like milk / And curdled me like cheese?<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> You have clothed me with skin and flesh / And woven me together with bones and sinews.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> You have granted me life and lovingkindness, / And Your visitation has preserved my spirit.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> But You have hidden these things in Your heart; / I know that this is with You:<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> If I sin, You mark me, / And You do not acquit me of my iniquity;<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> If I am wicked, woe unto me; / If I am righteous, I cannot lift up my head, / Being filled with dishonor and looking on my affliction.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And if my head should be lifted up, You would hunt me down like a lion, / And You would again demonstrate wonders on me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> You renew Your witnesses against me / And increase Your anger against me; / Attacking waves and a host are against me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> And why have You brought me out of the womb? / I should have died that no eye had seen me;<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> I should have been as though I had not been; / I should have been carried from birth to the grave.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> Are not my days few? Cease then, / And let me alone, that I may be somewhat revived,<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> Before I go, and never return, / To the land of darkness and the shadow of death,<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> The land of gloom like deep darkness, / The shadow of death without order, / Which shines like deep darkness.<br><br>
