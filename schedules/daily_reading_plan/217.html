  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> After this Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his <i>birth.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And Job responded and said,<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> Let the day on which I was born perish, / And the night which said, A man has been conceived.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Let that day be darkness; / Let God not seek it from above, / Nor let light shine upon it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> Let darkness and the shadow of death reclaim it; / Let a cloud dwell upon it; / Let the things that blacken the day terrify it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> As for that night, let deep darkness take hold of it; / Let it not rejoice among the days of the year; / Let it not come up in the number of the months.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Behold, let that night be barren; / Let no joyous shout come in it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> Let those curse it who curse the day, / Who are ready to rouse leviathan.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> Let its predawn stars be dark; / Let it wait for light and there be none, / And do not let it see the eyelids of the dawn.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> For it did not shut up the doors of the womb <i>that bore</i> me, / Nor did it hide trouble from my eyes.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> Why did I not die at birth, / Come forth from the womb and expire?<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> Why did the knees receive me? / And why the breasts, that I should suck?<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> For now I would have lain down and been undisturbed; / I would have slept; then I would have been at rest<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> With kings and counselors of the earth, / Who rebuilt ruins for themselves;<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> Or with princes who had gold, / Who filled their houses with silver.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> Or like a miscarriage that has been concealed, I would not have been, / Like infants that do not see the light.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> There the wicked cease from <i>their</i> troubling, / And there the weary rest.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> Captives are altogether at ease; / They do not hear the voice of the taskmaster.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> The small and the great are there, / And the servant is free from his master.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> Why does He give light to him who suffers / And life to the bitter in soul,<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> Who wait for death, but it is not there; / And dig for it more than for hidden treasures;<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> Who rejoice to the point of exultation / And are glad when they have found the grave;<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> To the man whose way is hidden / And whom God has hedged in?<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> For my sighing comes as my food, / And my groaning pours out like water.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> For I dread something, and it comes upon me; / And what I fear comes to me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> I have no ease and I have no quiet / And I have no rest, but trouble comes.<br><br>
