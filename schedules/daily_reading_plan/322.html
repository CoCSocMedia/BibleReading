  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Shout joyfully to God, all the earth;<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Sing forth the glory of His name; / Make glorious His praise.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> Say to God, How awesome are Your deeds! / Because of the greatness of Your strength, Your enemies come cringing to You.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> All the earth will worship You / And sing psalms to You; / They will sing psalms to Your name. Selah<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> Come and see the works of God; / He is awesome in <i>His</i> deeds toward the sons of men.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> He turned the sea into dry land; / Through the river they crossed on foot. / There we rejoiced in Him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> He rules by His might forever; / His eyes observe the nations: / Let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> Bless our God, O peoples; / And make the voice of His praise heard,<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> Who has kept our soul in life / And does not allow our feet to slip.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> For You have tried us, O God; / You have refined us as silver is refined.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> You have brought us into the net; / You have put a heavy burden on our loins.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> You have made men ride over our heads; / We have gone through fire and water; / But You have brought us forth into abundance.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> I will come into Your house with burnt offerings; / I will pay my vows to You,<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> Which my lips uttered / And my mouth spoke when I was in distress.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> I will offer to You burnt offerings of fatlings / With the smoke of rams; / I will offer cattle with goats. Selah<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> Come, hear, all you who fear God, / And I will recount what He has done for my soul.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> To Him I called out with my mouth, / And He was extolled with my tongue.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> If I regarded iniquity in my heart, / The Lord did not hear.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> But indeed God has heard; / He has given heed to the voice of my prayer.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> Blessed be God, / Who has not turned my prayer away / Nor His lovingkindness from me.<br><br>
