  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> But now, Job, hear my speaking, / And give ear to all my words.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Indeed now, I have opened my mouth; / My tongue has spoken in my mouth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> My words <i>manifest</i> the uprightness of my heart, / And what my lips know they speak sincerely.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> The Spirit of God has made me, / And the breath of the Almighty has enlivened me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> If you can, respond to me; / Arrange <i>your words</i> before me; take your stand.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> Indeed, I am before God as you are; / I too was cut out of clay.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> So no fear of me can terrify you, / Nor can my pressure be heavy upon you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> You have surely spoken in my hearing, / And I have heard the voice of <i>your</i> words, <i>saying,</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> I am clean <i>and</i> without transgression; / I am pure, and there is no iniquity in me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> See, He finds occasions for hostility against me; / He considers me as His enemy.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> He puts my feet in stocks; / He watches all my paths.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> However, in this you are not right, I will answer you, / For God is greater than man.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> Why do you contend with Him, / <i>Saying</i> that He does not answer for any of His affairs?<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> For God speaks in one way, / Indeed in two ways, without any perceiving it —<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> In a dream, a night vision, / When deep sleep falls upon men / In the slumberings upon <i>their</i> beds —<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> Then He opens the ears of men / And seals up their instruction,<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> That He may turn man aside <i>from his</i> doing / And hide pride from man.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> He keeps his soul from the pit, / And his life from perishing by the sword.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> He is also chastened with pain upon his bed / And with continual strife in his bones,<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> So that his life abhors bread, / And his soul, fancy food.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> His flesh is so consumed that it cannot be seen, / And his bones that had not been seen stick out.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> And his soul draws near to the pit, / And his life, to the destroyers.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> If there is with him an angel, / An interpreter, one of a thousand, / To declare to man what is right for him,<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> Then He will be gracious to him and will say, / Redeem him from going down into the pit; / I have found a ransom.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> His flesh will be fresher than in childhood; / He will return to the days of his youth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> He will pray to God, and He will accept him, / So that he sees His face with joyous shouting; / And God restores to man his righteousness.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> He will sing to men and say, / I sinned and perverted what was right, / But it was not paid back to me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> He has redeemed my soul from perishing in the pit, / And my life will see the light.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> Indeed, all these things God accomplishes for a man, / Twice, even three times,<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> To bring his soul back from the pit, / To enlighten <i>him</i> with the light of the living.<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> Take heed, Job; hear me. / Be silent, and I will speak.<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> If you have anything to say, answer me; / Speak, for I desire to justify you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> If not, you listen to me; / Be silent, and I will teach you wisdom.<br><br>
