  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And when all this was finished, all Israel who were present went out to the cities of Judah and broke down the pillars and hewed down the Asherahs and pulled down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin and in Ephraim and Manasseh until they destroyed <i>them all.</i> And all the children of Israel returned to their cities, each man to his own possessions.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And Hezekiah appointed the divisions of the priests and the Levites by their divisions, each of the priests and the Levites according to his service, for the burnt offering and for the peace offerings, to minister and give thanks and praise in the gates of the temple of Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> Also <i>he appointed</i> the king’s portion of his substance for the burnt offerings, the morning and evening burnt offerings and the burnt offerings of the Sabbaths and the new moon and the appointed feasts, as written in the law of Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And he commanded the people who dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion for the priests and the Levites, that they might devote themselves to the law of Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And when the commandment went out, the children of Israel gave in abundance the firstfruits of the grain <i>and</i> of the new wine and of the fresh oil and of the honey and of all the produce of the field; and they brought the tithe of everything in abundance.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And the children of Israel and Judah who dwelt in the cities of Judah also brought the tithe of the herd and of the flock and the tithe of the dedicated things, which had been dedicated to Jehovah their God, and laid them heap upon heap.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and in the seventh month they finished.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And when Hezekiah and the leaders came and saw the heaps, they blessed Jehovah and His people Israel.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> And Hezekiah inquired of the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps;<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And Azariah the chief priest, of the house of Zadok, spoke to him and said, Since the time that the people began to bring the contributions into the house of Jehovah, there has been eating and satisfaction and an abundance left over, for Jehovah has blessed His people and this great amount is left over.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> Then Hezekiah gave orders to prepare storechambers in the house of Jehovah, and they prepared <i>them.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And they brought in the contribution and the tithe and dedicated things faithfully. And Conaniah the Levite was ruler over them, and Shimei his brother was second,<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> And Jehiel and Azaziah and Nahath and Asahel and Jerimoth and Jozabad and Eliel and Ismachiah and Mahath and Benaiah were overseers under Conaniah and Shimei his brother by appointment of Hezekiah the king and Azariah the ruler of the house of God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> And Kore the son of Imna the Levite, the gatekeeper on the east, was over the freewill offerings of God, to distribute the contributions of Jehovah and the most holy things.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And under him were Eden and Miniamin and Jeshua and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, <i>serving</i> faithfully in the cities of the priests, to distribute <i>the portion</i> to their brothers by divisions, great and small alike,<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> Except for those who were enrolled by genealogy, males from three years old and upward, all who went to the house of Jehovah for <i>their</i> day-to-day duties, for their service in their offices by their divisions.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> Now concerning the enrollment of the priests by genealogy, it was by their fathers’ houses; and <i>that of</i> the Levites of those twenty years old and upward was by their offices in their divisions.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> And the enrollment by genealogy <i>included</i> all their little ones, their wives, and their sons and daughters, the whole congregation <i>of them;</i> for they sanctified themselves faithfully in holiness.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> And for the sons of Aaron the priests, who were in the pasture lands of their cities, in each and every city, there were men who were mentioned by name, to distribute portions to all the males among the priests and to all who were enrolled by genealogy among the Levites.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> And Hezekiah did this throughout all Judah, and he did what was good and upright and faithful before Jehovah his God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And in every work that he began in service to the house of God and in accordance with the law and the commandment, to seek after his God, he did <i>it</i> with all his heart and prospered.<br><br>
