  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Can you draw out leviathan with a hook, / Or press down his tongue with a cord?<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Can you put a rope in his nose, / Or pierce his jaw with a hook?<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> Will he make many supplications unto you, / Or speak soft words to you?<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Will he make a covenant with you / That you would take him as a servant forever?<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> Will you play with him as with a bird, / Or bind him for your maidens?<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> Will the traders bargain over him? / Will they divide him up among merchants?<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Can you fill his skin with harpoons, / Or his head with fishing spears?<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> Lay your hand on him, / <i>And</i> remember the battle — you will never do it again!<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> Indeed, any hope for him is vain; / Will not one be even cast down at the sight of him?<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> No one is so fierce as to stir him up; / Who then is he who would stand before Me?<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> Who has first given to Me that I should repay <i>him?</i> / <i>Whatever</i> is under the whole heaven is Mine.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> I will not be silent about his limbs / Or about the account of his mighty deeds or about the beauty of his frame.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> Who can strip off his outer garment? / Who can go within his double jaws?<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> Who can open the doors of his face? / Around his teeth is terror.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> <i>His</i> pride is <i>his</i> rows of scales, / Shut up <i>as with</i> a tight seal.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> One is so near the other / That the air cannot pass between them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> Each is joined to the other; / They stick together and cannot be separated.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> His sneezes flash forth light, / And his eyes are like the eyelids of the dawn.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> Out of his mouth go forth flaming torches; / Sparks of fire leap out.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> Out of his nostrils comes smoke, / As from a boiling pot and <i>burning</i> rushes.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> His breath kindles coals, / And a flame comes from his mouth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> In his neck abides strength, / And terror dances before him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> The folds of his flesh are joined together; / They are firm upon him <i>and</i> immovable.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> His heart is as firm as stone, / Indeed as firm as the lower millstone.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> At his rising up, the mighty fear; / They are beside themselves with consternation.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> The sword that reaches him cannot avail, / Nor the spear, the dart, or the javelin.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> He considers iron <i>shafts</i> as straw, / And bronze <i>ones</i> as rotted wood.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> The arrow does not make him flee; / With him slingstones turn to stubble.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> Clubs are considered as stubble; / He laughs at the quivering javelin.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> His underparts are <i>like</i> sharp potsherds; / He spreads himself <i>like</i> a threshing sledge upon the mire.<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> He makes the deep boil like a cauldron; / He makes the sea like a pot of ointment.<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> Behind him he makes a shining wake; / One would think the deep to be white-haired.<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> On earth there is none his equal, / Who is made without fear.<br><br>
     <sup><b>34</b></sup> He beholds everything that is high; / He is king over all the sons of pride.<br><br>
