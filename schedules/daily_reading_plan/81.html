  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of <i>it</i> (for he was still in Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon; and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And they sent <i>word to him</i> and called him), Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Your father made our yoke hard. Now therefore make the hard service of your father and his heavy yoke that he put upon us lighter, and we will serve you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And he said to them, Go away for another three days, then return to me. And the people went away.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> Then King Rehoboam took counsel with the elders who attended Solomon his father while he was alive, saying, What counsel do you give <i>me</i> to return as an answer to this people?<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And they spoke to him, saying, If today you will be a servant to this people and serve them and answer them and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants always.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> But he forsook the counsel of the elders with which they counseled him and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him, who attended him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> And he said to them, What counsel do you give <i>me</i> that we may return an answer to this people who have spoken to me, saying, Lighten the yoke that your father put upon us?<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And the young men who grew up with him spoke to him, saying, Thus shall you say to this people who have spoken to you, saying, Your father made our yoke heavy, but you must make <i>it</i> lighter on us; thus shall you speak to them, My little finger is thicker than my father’s loins.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And now, whereas my father laid a heavy yoke upon you, I will increase your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day as the king had spoken, saying, Return to me on the third day.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> And the king answered the people harshly; and he forsook the counsel of the elders that they had given <i>him</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> And spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will increase your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> So the king did not listen to the people, for this turn of events was of Jehovah that He might establish His word which Jehovah had spoken through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And when all Israel saw that the king would not listen to them, the people returned an answer to the king, saying, What portion do we have in David? Neither do we have an inheritance in the son of Jesse. To your tents, O Israel. Now see to your own house, O David. And Israel went to their tents.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> But as for the children of Israel who dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> Then King Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the forced labor, and all Israel stoned him to death. And King Rehoboam made haste to get up into his chariot and flee to Jerusalem.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> So Israel has rebelled against the house of David until this day.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> And when all Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned, they sent <i>word</i> to him and called him to the assembly; and they made him king over all Israel. There was none who followed the house of David except the tribe of Judah alone.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And when Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, he gathered all the house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin, one hundred eighty thousand choice warriors, to wage war with the house of Israel in order to return the kingdom to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, the king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin and to the rest of the people, saying,<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> Thus says Jehovah, You shall not go up and wage war with your brothers the children of Israel. Every man return to his house; for this matter is of Me. So they listened to the word of Jehovah and returned and went <i>their way</i> according to the word of Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> Then Jeroboam built up Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and he dwelt in it; and he went forth from there and built up Penuel.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now the kingdom will return to the house of David.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> If this people go up to make sacrifices in the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem, the heart of this people will return to their lord, to Rehoboam the king of Judah; and they will slay me and return to Rehoboam the king of Judah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> And the king took counsel and made two calves of gold. And he said to them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem. Behold your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> And he set one in Bethel, and he put the other one in Dan.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> And this thing became a sin; and the people went <i>to worship</i> the one as far as Dan.<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> And he made a house of high places and appointed priests from among the people who were not from the sons of Levi.<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like the feast that is in Judah, and he went up to the altar; he did likewise at Bethel, sacrificing to the calves that he had made. And he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places that he had made.<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> And he went up to the altar that he had made at Bethel on the fifteenth day, in the eighth month, <i>that is,</i> the month he had devised in his own heart; and he ordained a feast for the children of Israel and went up to the altar to burn incense.<br><br>
