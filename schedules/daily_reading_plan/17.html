  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And the boy Samuel ministered to Jehovah before Eli. Now the word of Jehovah was rare in those days; visions were not widespread.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And at that time Eli lay in his place, and his eyesight had begun to grow dim, so that he could not see.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And the lamp of God had not yet gone out. And Samuel lay in the temple of Jehovah, where the Ark of God was.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Then Jehovah called to Samuel. And he said, Here I am.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And he ran to Eli and said, Here I am, for you called me. And he said, I did not call. Go back <i>and</i> lie down. And he went and lay down.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And Jehovah called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel rose up and went to Eli and said, Here I am, for you called me. And he said, I did not call, my son. Go back <i>and</i> lie down.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Now Samuel did not yet know Jehovah, and the word of Jehovah had not yet been revealed to him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> Then Jehovah called Samuel again, the third time. And he rose up and went to Eli and said, Here I am, for you called me. Then Eli perceived that it was Jehovah calling the boy.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> And Eli said to Samuel, Go <i>and</i> lie down, and if He calls you, you shall say, Speak, O Jehovah; for Your servant is listening. And Samuel went and lay down in his place.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> Then Jehovah came and stood by and called as at the other times, Samuel! Samuel! And Samuel said, Speak, for Your servant is listening.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And Jehovah said to Samuel, I am about to do something in Israel which will make both ears of anyone who hears <i>of it</i> tingle.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> On that day I will fulfill against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from beginning to end.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> For I have told him that I am about to judge his house forever because of the iniquity which he knew; for his sons brought the curse upon themselves, and he did not restrain them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> And therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli that the iniquity of the house of Eli shall not be expiated by sacrifice or by offering forever.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And Samuel lay down until the morning, when he opened the doors of the house of Jehovah. And Samuel was afraid to tell the vision to Eli.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> But Eli called Samuel and said, Samuel my son. And he said, Here I am.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> And he said, What was the word that He spoke to you? Do not hide <i>it</i> from me. May God do so to you, and even more, if you hide from me any of the word which He spoke to you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> So Samuel told him everything and did not hide <i>anything</i> from him. And he said, He is Jehovah; let Him do what is good in His sight.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> And Samuel grew, and Jehovah was with him and let none of his words fall to the ground.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> And all Israel, from Dan to Beer-sheba, knew that Samuel had been established as a prophet of Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And Jehovah continued to appear in Shiloh, for Jehovah revealed Himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of Jehovah.<br><br>
