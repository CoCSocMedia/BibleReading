  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then Job answered and said,<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> I do indeed know that it is so. / But how can a man be righteous before God?<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> If he is pleased to contend with Him, / He cannot answer Him one thing in a thousand.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> He is wise in heart and mighty in strength — / Who has <i>ever</i> resisted Him and come through whole? —<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> He who removes mountains, and they do not know <i>it,</i> / When He overturns them in His anger;<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> Who shakes the earth from its place, / And its pillars shake;<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Who commands the sun, and it does not rise, / And seals up the stars;<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> Who alone stretched forth the heavens / And trod upon the heights of the sea;<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> Who made the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, / And the chambers of the south;<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> Who does great things that cannot be searched, / Indeed, wonderful deeds that cannot be numbered.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> Indeed, He passes by me, but I do not see <i>Him;</i> / And He goes by, but I do not perceive Him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> Indeed, He snatches away; who can stop Him? / Who can say to Him, What are You doing?<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> God does not turn back His anger; / Under Him Rahab’s helpers stoop.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> How then can I answer Him / And choose my words <i>properly</i> with Him?<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> I, though righteous, could not answer <i>Him;</i> / I could <i>only</i> plead for mercy before my Judge.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> If I called out and He answered me, / I do not believe that He would hearken to my voice.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> For He crushes me with a whirlwind / And multiplies my wounds without cause.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> He does not permit me to catch my breath, / But fills me with bitterness.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> If <i>we speak</i> of strength, indeed, <i>He is</i> mighty! / Or if of judgment, Who, <i>says He,</i> can appoint Me a time?<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> Though I am righteous, my mouth would condemn me; / Though I am perfect, it would prove me perverse.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> I am perfect; I do not regard my soul; / I despise my life.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> It is <i>all</i> one; therefore I say, / He destroys the perfect and the wicked.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> If some scourge suddenly kills, / He derides the despair of the innocent.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> The earth is given into the hand of the wicked; / He covers the faces of its judges. / If not <i>He,</i> then who is it?<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> And my days are swifter than a running messenger; / They flee away, they do not see good;<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> They go by like reed boats, / Like an eagle swooping on the prey.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> If I say, I will forget my complaint, / I will put off my <i>sad</i> countenance and look cheerful;<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> I fear all my pains: / I know that You will not hold me innocent.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> I will be accounted wicked; / Why then do I labor in vain?<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> If I wash myself with soap / And cleanse my hands with lye,<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> Yet You will plunge me into the pit, / And my own garments will abhor me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> For <i>He is</i> not a man, as I am, that I should answer Him, / That we should enter into litigation together.<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> There is no referee between us, / Who may lay his hand upon us both.<br><br>
     <sup><b>34</b></sup> Let Him take His rod away from me, / And let not the dread of Him terrify me;<br><br>
     <sup><b>35</b></sup> <i>Then</i> I would speak and not be afraid; / For I am not such.<br><br>
