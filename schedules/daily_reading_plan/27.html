  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Saul was…years old when he began to reign; and he reigned over Israel two years.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And Saul chose three thousand men from Israel for himself; and two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in the hill country of Bethel, and one thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin. And the rest of the people he sent away, every man to his tent.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And Jonathan struck the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard <i>of it.</i> And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear!<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And when all Israel heard that Saul had struck the garrison of the Philistines and also that Israel had become odious to the Philistines, the people gathered themselves behind Saul at Gilgal.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And the Philistines assembled themselves for battle with Israel, thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen and people like the sand that is on the seashore in multitude. And they came up and encamped in Michmash, east of Beth-aven.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> When the men of Israel saw that they were in distress (for the people were hard pressed), the people hid themselves in caves and in thickets and among rocks and in cellars and in pits.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And some Hebrews crossed over the Jordan into the land of Gad and Gilead; but Saul was still in Gilgal, and all the people trembled behind him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And he waited for seven days, until the time appointed by Samuel, but Samuel did not come to Gilgal. And the people scattered from him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> Then Saul said, Bring the burnt offering and the peace offerings to me. And he offered up the burnt offering.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And just as he finished offering up the burnt offering, there came Samuel; and Saul went out to meet him and greet him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And Samuel said, What have you done? And Saul said, When I saw that the people were scattered from me and that you had not come at the appointed time and that the Philistines assembled themselves at Michmash,<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> I said, Now the Philistines will come down on me at Gilgal, and I have not entreated the favor of Jehovah. Therefore I forced myself to offer up the burnt offering.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> Then Samuel said to Saul, You have acted foolishly; you have not kept the commandment of Jehovah your God, which He commanded you. For now Jehovah would have established your kingdom over Israel forever;<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> But now your kingdom will not continue. Jehovah has sought a man according to His heart for Himself, and Jehovah has appointed him ruler over His people; for you have not kept that which Jehovah commanded you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> Then Samuel rose and went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul mustered the people who were with him, about six hundred men.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And Saul and Jonathan his son and the people who were with them dwelt in Geba of Benjamin, and the Philistines encamped in Michmash.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> And the raiders came out from the camp of the Philistines in three companies. One company turned toward Ophrah, to the land of Shual;<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> And another company turned toward Beth-horon; and another company turned toward the border that overlooks the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> Now there was no smith to be found throughout all the land of Israel, for the Philistines had said, Lest the Hebrews make swords or spears;<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> Therefore all Israel would go down to the Philistines so that each might sharpen his plowshare or his mattock or his ax or his hoe.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And the price was two-thirds of a shekel for plowshares and for mattocks and for three-pronged forks and for axes and for setting the goads.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> So on the day of the battle there was not a sword or spear to be found in the hand of any of the people who were with Saul and with Jonathan, but <i>such</i> were found with Saul and Jonathan his son.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash.<br><br>
