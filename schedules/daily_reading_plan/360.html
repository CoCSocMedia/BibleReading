  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Bless Jehovah, O my soul. / O Jehovah my God, You are very great. / You are clothed with majesty and splendor,<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Wrapped with light as with a garment; / You stretch out the heavens like a tent curtain.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> He lays the beams of His upper chambers in the waters; / He makes the clouds His chariot; / He walks upon the wings of the wind.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> He makes winds His messengers, / Flames of fire His ministers.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> He established the earth upon its foundations, / So that it cannot be moved forever and ever.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> You covered it with the deep as with a garment; / The waters stood above the mountains.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> At Your rebuke they fled; / At the voice of Your thunder they rushed away —<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> The mountains rose, the valleys sank — / To the place that You established for them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> You set a border that they may not pass over, / That they may not turn back to cover the earth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> He makes the springs gush forth in the valleys; / They run among the mountains;<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> They give drink to every beast of the field; / The wild asses quench their thirst.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> The birds of heaven dwell alongside them; / They utter their voice among the branches.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> He waters the mountains from His upper chambers. / The earth is satisfied with the fruit of Your works.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> He causes the grass to grow for the cattle, / And herbage for man’s use, / That he may bring forth food from the earth:<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> Even wine that cheers man’s heart, / Oil that makes <i>his</i> face shine, / And bread that sustains man’s heart.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> The trees of Jehovah are full <i>of sap,</i> / The cedars of Lebanon, which He planted,<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> Where the birds build their nests; / As for the stork, the cypresses are her house.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> The high mountains are for the wild goats; / The cliffs are a refuge to the rock badgers.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> He made the moon to <i>mark</i> seasons; / The sun knows <i>the time</i> of its going down.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> You make darkness, and it is night, / In which all the beasts of the forest creep about.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> The young lions roar after their prey, / Even to seek their food from God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> The sun rises: they retreat / And lie down in their dens.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> Man goes forth to his work / And to his labor until evening.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> How many are Your works, O Jehovah! / In wisdom You have made all of them; / The earth is full of Your creatures.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> Yonder is the sea, great and extensively wide; / There the creeping things are, even without number, / The small animals with the great.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> There the ships go; / Leviathan is there, whom You have formed / To play in it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> They all wait for You, / That You may give them food at the proper time.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> You give to them; they gather. / You open Your hand; they are satisfied with good.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> You hide Your face; they are troubled. / You take away their breath; they perish, / And return to their dust.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> You send forth Your Spirit; they are created, / And You renew the surface of the ground.<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> May the glory of Jehovah endure forever! / May Jehovah rejoice in His works,<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> He who looks on the earth, and it trembles; / He who touches the mountains, and they smoke!<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> I will sing to Jehovah while I live; / I will sing psalms to my God while I yet have being.<br><br>
     <sup><b>34</b></sup> May my musing be sweet to Him; / I will rejoice in Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>35</b></sup> May the sinners be consumed from off the earth, / And may the wicked be no more. / Bless Jehovah, O my soul. / Hallelujah.<br><br>
