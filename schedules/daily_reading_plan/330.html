  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Why, O God, have You cast <i>us</i> off forever? / <i>Why</i> does Your anger smoke against the sheep of Your pasture?<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Remember Your assembly, which You have purchased of old, / Which You have redeemed <i>as</i> the tribe of Your inheritance, / <i>And</i> Mount Zion, where You dwell.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> Lift up Your steps unto the perpetual ruins; / The enemy has damaged everything in the sanctuary.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Your adversaries have roared in the midst of Your assembly place; / They have set up their symbols as signs.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> It looked like when men bring up axes / On the thicket of the trees.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And now they have struck down with hatchet and hammer / Its carved work altogether.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> They have set fire to Your sanctuary; / They have defiled the dwelling place of Your name to the ground.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> They said in their heart, Let us oppress them completely. / They have burned down all God’s assembly places in the land.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> We do not see our signs; there is no longer a prophet, / Nor is there anyone among us who knows how long.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> How long, O God, will the adversary reproach? / Will the enemy despise Your name forever?<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> Why do You withdraw Your hand, even Your right hand? / <i>Bring it forth</i> from the midst of Your bosom; destroy <i>them.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> But God is my King of old, / Accomplishing salvation in the midst of the earth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> You divided the sea by Your strength; / You broke the heads of the sea serpents on the waters.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> You crushed the heads of the leviathan; / You gave him as food to the creatures of the desert.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> You broke open the fountain and the torrent; / You dried up the ever-flowing streams.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> The day is Yours; the night also is Yours; / You prepared the moon and the sun.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> You established all the borders of the earth: / You formed the summer and the winter.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> Remember this: The enemy has reproached Jehovah, / And a foolish people has despised Your name.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> Do not give the soul of Your turtledove to the wild beast; / Do not forget the life of Your poor forever.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> Regard the covenant, / For the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of violence.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> Do not let him who is oppressed return ashamed. / May the poor and needy praise Your name.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> Arise, O God; contend for Your own cause; / Remember how the foolish man reproaches You all day long.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> Do not forget the voice of Your adversaries; / The roar of those who rise up against You goes up continually.<br><br>
