  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And the queen of Sheba had heard of Solomon’s fame in connection with the name of Jehovah, and she came to test him with hard questions.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And she came to Jerusalem with a very large retinue, with camels bearing spices and with very much gold and precious stones. And when she came to Solomon, she spoke all that was on her heart to him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And Solomon answered every matter of hers; there was nothing hidden from the king that he did not answer her.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And when the queen of Sheba saw all the wisdom of Solomon and the house that he had built<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And the food of his table and the seating of his servants and the service and apparel of his ministers and his cupbearers and his burnt offerings that he offered up at the house of Jehovah, there was no more spirit in her.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And she said to the king, The word that I heard in my land concerning your deeds and your wisdom is true,<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> But I did not believe the words until I came and my own eyes saw. And indeed the half was not told to me; your wisdom and prosperity far exceed the report that I heard.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> Happy are your men! Happy are these your servants, who attend you continually <i>and</i> hear your wisdom!<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> Blessed be Jehovah your God, who has delighted in you and set you upon the throne of Israel. Because Jehovah loves Israel forever, He has made you king to execute justice and righteousness.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold and a very great store of spices and some precious stones; never again did so great an abundance of spices come as that which the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> Moreover Hiram’s fleet, which carried gold from Ophir, brought a great many almug trees and precious stones.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And the king made of the almug trees a banister for the house of Jehovah and for the king’s house, and lyres and harps for the singers; such almug trees have not come nor have been seen again to this day.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> And King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all that she desired, whatever she asked for, besides that which King Solomon gave her from <i>his</i> bounty. And she returned and went to her own land, she and her servants.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred sixty-six talents of gold,<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> Besides <i>that which came through</i> the traders and through the traffic of the merchants and through all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the land.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And King Solomon made two hundred large shields of beaten gold; he put six hundred <i>shekels</i> of gold upon each large shield.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> And <i>he made</i> three hundred smaller shields of beaten gold; he put three minas of gold upon each smaller shield. And the king put them in the Lebanon Forest House.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> And the king made a large ivory throne and overlaid it with the finest gold.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was rounded at its back; and there were armrests on either side next to the place of the seat, and two lions stood next to the armrests.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> And twelve lions stood there upon the six steps on either side. Nothing like it had ever been made in any kingdom.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And all King Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the Lebanon Forest House were of pure gold; none were of silver, <i>which was</i> not considered as anything in the days of Solomon.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> For the king had at sea a fleet from Tarshish as well as Hiram’s fleet. Once every three years the fleet from Tarshish came bearing gold and silver and ivory and apes and peacocks.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> And King Solomon excelled all the kings of the earth in wealth and in wisdom.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> And all the earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> And they each brought their tribute, vessels of silver and vessels of gold, and robes and weapons and spices, horses and mules, so much year by year.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen together; and he had a thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen, which he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king at Jerusalem.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> And the king caused silver to be as plentiful as stones in Jerusalem; and cedars, like the sycamores that are in the lowlands.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> And the horses that Solomon had came from Egypt and from Kue; the king’s traders bought <i>them</i> from Kue at a fixed price.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> A chariot could be imported from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver and a horse for a hundred and fifty shekels, and thus they brought <i>them</i> out to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria by their own means.<br><br>
