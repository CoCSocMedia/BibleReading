  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then Jehovah answered Job out of the whirlwind and said,<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Who is this who darkens counsel / By words without knowledge?<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> Gird up now your loins like a mighty man; / For I will ask of you, and you shall inform Me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? / Tell <i>Me,</i> if you have understanding.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> Who set its measurements — if you know? / Or who stretched the measuring line over it?<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> Onto what were its bases sunk, / Or who laid its cornerstone,<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> When the morning stars sang together / And all the sons of God shouted for joy?<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And <i>who</i> hedged in the sea with doors / When it burst forth, issuing from the womb,<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> When I made clouds its clothing / And deep darkness its swaddling clothes,<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And I broke out My boundaries for it / And set up bars and doors,<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And I said, To here you shall come and no farther, / And here shall your proud waves be stopped?<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> Have you ever commanded the morning since your days <i>began?</i> / Have you ever caused the dawn to know its place,<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> So that it might take hold of the ends of the earth, / And the wicked might be shaken out of it?<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> The earth is changed like clay under a seal, / And all things on it stand forth like a garment.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And from the wicked their light is withheld, / And the high arm is broken.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> Have you entered into the springs of the sea, / Or have you walked about in the recesses of the deep?<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> Have the gates of death been revealed to you, / Or have you seen the gates of the shadow of death?<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> Have you comprehended the full expanse of the earth? / Declare <i>it,</i> if you know it all.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> Where is the way to the dwelling of the light? / And the darkness, where is its place,<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> That you may take it to its boundary, / And that you may perceive the paths to its house?<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> You know, for you were born then, / And the number of your days is great.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> Have you entered into the storehouses of the snow, / Or have you seen the storehouses of the hail,<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> Which I have reserved for the day of calamity, / For the day of battle and of war?<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> Where is the way to <i>the place where</i> the light is divided, / To <i>the place where</i> the east wind scatters upon the earth?<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> Who cut a channel for the rain torrent, / Or a way for the thunderbolt,<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> To make it rain on a land where no man is, / <i>On</i> a wilderness in which there is no man;<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> To satisfy the waste and desolate land / And to cause the shoots of grass to sprout?<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> Does the rain have a father? / Or who begot the drops of dew?<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> From whose womb does the ice come forth? / And the frost of heaven, who gave birth to it?<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> The waters hide themselves <i>and become</i> like stone, / And the surface of the deep is frozen.<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> Can you fasten the bands of the Pleiades, / Or loosen the cords of Orion?<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> Can you lead forth the Mazzaroth in their season? / Or can you guide the Bear with its cubs?<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> Do you know the laws of the heavens? / Do you establish their rule on the earth?<br><br>
     <sup><b>34</b></sup> Can you lift up your voice to the clouds, / So that a flood of water would cover you?<br><br>
     <sup><b>35</b></sup> Can you send forth lightnings, so that they would go / And say to you, Here we are?<br><br>
     <sup><b>36</b></sup> Who has put wisdom in the inward parts, / Or given understanding to the mind?<br><br>
     <sup><b>37</b></sup> Who can number the clouds by wisdom, / Or who can tip over the water jars of heaven,<br><br>
     <sup><b>38</b></sup> When the dust runs into a mass / And the clods stick together?<br><br>
     <sup><b>39</b></sup> Can you hunt prey for the lioness, / Or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,<br><br>
     <sup><b>40</b></sup> When they crouch in their dens, / <i>When</i> they lie in wait in the thicket?<br><br>
     <sup><b>41</b></sup> Who provides for the raven its prey / When its young ones cry out to God / <i>And</i> wander about for lack of food?<br><br>
