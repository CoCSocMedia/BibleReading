  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Now Jehovah had spoken to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying,<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Let the children of Israel keep the passover at its appointed time.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> On the fourteenth day of this month at twilight, you shall keep it at its appointed time; according to all its statutes and according to all its ordinances you shall keep it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Thus Moses told the children of Israel to keep the passover.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And they kept the passover in the first <i>month,</i> on the fourteenth day of the month, at twilight, in the wilderness of Sinai; according to all that Jehovah commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> But there were certain men who were unclean through <i>contact with</i> a dead person, so that they could not keep the passover on that day; so they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And those men said to him, Although we are unclean through <i>contact with</i> a dead person, why must we be kept from presenting the offering of Jehovah at its appointed time among the children of Israel?<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And Moses said to them, Stay <i>here</i> so I may hear what Jehovah will command concerning you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Any one of you or your descendants who becomes unclean through <i>contact with</i> a <i>dead</i> person or is on a distant journey shall still keep the passover to Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> In the second month on the fourteenth day at twilight they shall keep it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> They shall not leave any of it until the morning, nor break a bone of it; according to every statute of the passover they shall keep it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> But the man who is clean and is not on a journey yet refrains from keeping the passover, that person shall be cut off from his people, because he did not present Jehovah’s offering at its appointed time; that man shall bear his sin.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> And if a stranger sojourns with you and keeps the passover to Jehovah; according to the statute of the passover and according to its ordinance, so shall he do. You shall have one statute, both for the sojourner and for the native <i>born</i> in the land.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And on the day that the tabernacle was set up, the cloud covered the tabernacle, the Tent of the Testimony; and in the evening it was like the appearance of fire over the tabernacle until morning.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> So it was always; the cloud covered it <i>by day,</i> and the appearance of fire by night.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> And whenever the cloud was taken up from over the tent, then after that the children of Israel set out; and in the place where the cloud settled, there the children of Israel encamped.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> At the commandment of Jehovah the children of Israel set out, and at the commandment of Jehovah they encamped; as long as the cloud settled upon the tabernacle, they remained encamped.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> Even when the cloud extended <i>its time</i> over the tabernacle for many days, the children of Israel kept the charge of Jehovah and did not set out.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> If sometimes the cloud was upon the tabernacle a few days, according to the commandment of Jehovah they remained encamped; then at the commandment of Jehovah they set out.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> If sometimes the cloud remained from evening until morning, when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they set out; or <i>if it remained</i> a day and a night, when the cloud was taken up, they set out.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> Whether it was two days or a month or a longer time that the cloud extended <i>its time</i> over the tabernacle and settled above it, the children of Israel remained encamped and did not set out; but when it was taken up, they set out.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> At the commandment of Jehovah they encamped, and at the commandment of Jehovah they set out. They kept the charge of Jehovah according to the commandment of Jehovah through Moses.<br><br>
