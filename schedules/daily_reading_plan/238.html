  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Why are times <i>of judgment</i> not stored up by the Almighty? / And why do those who know Him not see His days?<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Some remove landmarks; / They seize the flock and pasture <i>them.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> They drive away the donkey of the fatherless / And take the widow’s ox as a pledge.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> They turn the needy out of the way; / The poor of the land are made to hide together.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> Indeed, <i>like</i> wild asses in the desert, / They go forth to their work, / Diligently seeking some prey; / The wilderness <i>provides</i> them food for their children.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> In the field they harvest their fodder, / And they glean the vintage of the wicked.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> They spend the night naked, without clothing; / And have no covering in the cold.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> They are wet from the mountain showers, / And for lack of shelter they embrace the rock.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> Some pluck the fatherless from the breast, / And what the poor has on, as a pledge.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> They go about naked, without clothing; / And being hungry, they take up the sheaves.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> Between their walls they press out oil; / They tread the winepresses yet suffer thirst.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> From the city men groan, / And the soul of the wounded cries out; / Yet God does not regard the folly.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> These are among those who rebel against the light; / They are not acquainted with its ways, / Nor do they abide in its paths.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> The murderer rises at dawn; / He kills the poor and the needy; / And at night he is like a thief.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> The eye of the adulterer also watches for the twilight, / Saying, Not an eye will see me; / And he disguises his face.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> They dig through houses in the dark; / By day they shut themselves in: / They do not know the light.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> For morning is to all of them <i>like</i> the shadow of death, / Because they are acquainted with the terrors of the shadow of death.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> Swift are they upon the face of the waters; / Their portion is cursed in the earth; / There is none who turns toward the vineyards.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> Drought and heat snatch the snow water, / <i>As</i> Sheol <i>snatches</i> those who have sinned.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> The womb forgets him; / The worm finds him sweet; / He is remembered no more; / And wrongdoing is broken like a tree.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> He despoils the barren woman who does not bear, / And does no good for the widow.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> But <i>God</i> preserves the mighty by His power; / He arises, and no one is certain of life.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> He grants a man to be secure, and he rests <i>on it;</i> / And His eyes are upon their ways.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> They are exalted a little while, then they are no more; / And they are brought low; like all <i>others,</i> they are gathered in / And are cut off like the tops of the ears of grain.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> And if it is not so, then who will prove me a liar / And bring my words to nought?<br><br>
