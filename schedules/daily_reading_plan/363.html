  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Give thanks to Jehovah, for He is good, / For His lovingkindness is forever.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Let the redeemed of Jehovah say <i>so,</i> / Whom He redeemed from the hand of the adversary,<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And gathered out of the lands, / From the east and from the west, / From the north and from the south.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> They wandered in the wilderness, on the desert way; / They found no city of habitation.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> Hungry and thirsty, / Their soul fainted within them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> Then they cried out to Jehovah in their trouble, / <i>And</i> He delivered them from their distresses.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And He led them on a straight way / That they might come to a city of habitation.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> Let them give thanks to Jehovah for His lovingkindness / And for His wondrous deeds to the children of men.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> For He satisfies the thirsty soul, / And the famished soul He fills with good.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> Some inhabited darkness and the shadow of death, / <i>And</i> were bound in affliction and irons,<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> Because they rebelled against the words of God / And spurned the counsel of the Most High;<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> Therefore He brought down their heart with labor; / They stumbled, and there was no one to help <i>them.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> Then they cried out to Jehovah in their trouble, / <i>And</i> He saved them from their distresses.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, / And He broke apart their bonds.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> Let them give thanks to Jehovah for His lovingkindness / And for His wondrous deeds to the children of men.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> For He breaks down the doors of bronze / And cuts down the bars of iron.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> Some were fools, because of their way of transgression; / And because of their iniquities, they were afflicted.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> Their soul loathed all food, / And they drew near to the gates of death.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> Then they cried out to Jehovah in their trouble, / <i>And</i> He saved them out of their distresses.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> He sent forth His word and healed them, / And He delivered them from the pits <i>of destruction.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> Let them give thanks to Jehovah for His lovingkindness / And for His wondrous deeds to the children of men.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> And let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving / And declare His doings in joyful song.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> Those who go down to the sea in ships, / Conducting business on the mighty waters,<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> These see Jehovah’s doings / And His wondrous deeds in the deep.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> For He commanded and raised up a storm wind, / And it lifted up the waves of the sea.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> They mounted up to the heavens; they went down to the depths; / Their soul melted in the calamity.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> They reeled and staggered like a drunken man, / And all their skill was swallowed up.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> Then they cried out to Jehovah in their trouble, / And He brought them out of their distresses.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> He made the storm be still, / And the waves of the sea were calm;<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> And they rejoiced that they were quiet, / And He brought them to the haven they desired.<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> Let them give thanks to Jehovah for His lovingkindness / And for His wondrous deeds to the children of men.<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> And let them exalt Him in the congregation of the people / And praise Him in the assembly of the elders.<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> He turns rivers into a wilderness, / And springs of water into thirsty ground;<br><br>
     <sup><b>34</b></sup> Fruitful land into a salt flat, / Because of the wickedness of those who dwell in it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>35</b></sup> He turns a wilderness into a pool of water, / And a dry land into springs of water.<br><br>
     <sup><b>36</b></sup> And He makes the hungry dwell there, / That they may prepare a city of habitation<br><br>
     <sup><b>37</b></sup> And sow fields and plant vineyards / And get a fruitful yield.<br><br>
     <sup><b>38</b></sup> He also blesses them, and they are multiplied greatly; / And He does not let their cattle decrease.<br><br>
     <sup><b>39</b></sup> When they are diminished and bowed down / Through oppression, trouble, and sorrow,<br><br>
     <sup><b>40</b></sup> He pours contempt on princes, / And makes them wander in a pathless waste.<br><br>
     <sup><b>41</b></sup> But He raises the needy man high above affliction / And makes <i>his</i> families like flocks.<br><br>
     <sup><b>42</b></sup> The upright see <i>it</i> and rejoice; / And all iniquity stops its mouth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>43</b></sup> Who is wise? Then let him observe these things / And consider the lovingkindness of Jehovah.<br><br>
