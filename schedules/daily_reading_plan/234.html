  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said,<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Because of this, my disquieting thoughts answer me; / And hence my haste is in me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> I hear the reproof that humiliates me, / And the spirit of my understanding answers me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Do you not know this from of old, / Since man was set upon the earth,<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> That the joyous shouting of the wicked is short, / And the rejoicing of the profane is but for a moment?<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> Though his arrogance goes up to heaven, / And his head touches the clouds;<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Like his own dung he perishes forever; / Those who have seen him say, Where is he?<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> Like a dream he flies away and is not found; / Indeed he is chased away like a vision of the night.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> The eye looks on him then <i>sees him</i> no more, / Nor does his place observe him anymore.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> His children seek the favor of the poor, / And his hands return his wealth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> His bones are full of youthful vigor, / Yet it lies down with him in the dust.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> Though wickedness is sweet in his mouth, / <i>Though</i> he hides it under his tongue,<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> <i>Though</i> he favors it and will not forsake it, / But holds it in his mouth;<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> His food in his bowels is changed; / It is the venom of asps within him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> He swallows down riches and vomits them up; / God casts them forth from his stomach.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> He sucks the poison of asps; / The tongue of the viper slays him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> He will not look on the rivers, / The streams flowing with honey and butter.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> He will return what he toiled for and will not swallow <i>it</i> down; / And he will not rejoice according to the wealth of his trading.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> For he has oppressed <i>and</i> abandoned the poor; / He has violently seized a house that he did not build.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> Because he knew no respite in his craving, / Of that which he desired he will save nothing.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> There will be nothing left of what he has devoured; / Thus his prosperity will not endure.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> In the fullness of his sufficiency he will be distressed; / The hand of everyone in trouble will come against him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> In order to fill his belly, / God will send the burning fierceness of His wrath on him / And will rain <i>it</i> upon him as his food.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> He will flee from the iron weapon, / <i>But</i> the bronze bow will strike him through.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> He draws <i>the arrow</i> out, and it comes out of his body; / Indeed the glittering point goes forth from his gall. / Terrors <i>come</i> upon him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> Total darkness is laid up as his treasures; / A fire not fanned <i>by man</i> will devour him; / It will feed on what is left in his tent.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> The heavens will reveal his iniquity, / And the earth will rise up against him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> The increase of his house will depart / As things swept away in the day of His wrath.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> This is the wicked man’s portion from God / And the inheritance decreed to him by God.<br><br>
