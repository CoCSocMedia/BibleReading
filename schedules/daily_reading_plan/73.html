  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Now King Solomon was king over all Israel.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And these were the officials with him: Azariah the son of Zadok, the priest;<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder;<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the army; and Zadok and Abiathar were <i>high</i> priests;<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And Azariah the son of Nathan was over the superintendents; and Zabud the son of Nathan was the principal officer, the king’s friend;<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And Ahishar was over the household; and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the forced labor.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And Solomon had twelve superintendents over all Israel, who provided food for the king and his house; each month of the year one had to provide food.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And these are their names: Ben-hur, in the hill country of Ephraim;<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> Ben-deker, in Makaz and in Shaalbim and Beth-shemesh and Elon-beth-hanan;<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> Ben-hesed, in Arubboth (to him <i>pertained</i> Socoh and all the land of Hepher);<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> Ben-abinadab, <i>in</i> all the highland of Dor (he had Taphath the daughter of Solomon as <i>his</i> wife);<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> Baana the son of Ahilud, <i>in</i> Taanach and Megiddo and all Beth-shean, which is beside Zarethan, beneath Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah, as far as beyond Jokmeam;<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> Ben-geber, in Ramoth-gilead (to him <i>pertained</i> the villages of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; <i>and</i> to him <i>pertained</i> the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, sixty great cities with walls and bronze bars);<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> Ahinadab the son of Iddo, <i>in</i> Mahanaim;<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> Ahimaaz, in Naphtali (he also took Basemath the daughter of Solomon as <i>his</i> wife);<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> Baana the son of Hushai, in Asher and Bealoth;<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar;<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> Shimei the son of Ela, in Benjamin;<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> Geber the son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, the land of Sihon the king of the Amorites and Og the king of Bashan (and there was <i>only</i> one superintendent in that land).<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> Judah and Israel were as numerous as the sand that is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking and rejoicing.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River to the land of the Philistines and unto the border of Egypt; they brought tribute and served Solomon all the days of his life.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> And Solomon’s provisions for one day were thirty cors of fine flour and sixty cors of meal,<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> Ten fattened oxen and twenty pastured oxen and a hundred sheep, besides deer and gazelles and roebucks and fattened fowl.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> For he had dominion over all <i>the area</i> west of the River, from Tiphsah to Gaza, over all the kings west of the River; and he had peace on all sides around him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> And Judah and Israel dwelt securely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan to Beer-sheba, throughout all Solomon’s days.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots and twelve thousand horsemen.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> And those superintendents provided food for King Solomon and for all who came to King Solomon’s table, each in his month; they left nothing lacking.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> And they also brought to the place where it should be, barley and straw for the horses and steeds, each according to his charge.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> And God gave Solomon wisdom and very much understanding and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the seashore.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> And Solomon’s wisdom was greater than the wisdom of all the children of the east and all the wisdom of Egypt.<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> For he became wiser than all men, <i>wiser</i> than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Calcol and Darda, the sons of Mahol. And his fame was among all the surrounding nations.<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> And he spoke three thousand proverbs, and his songs numbered a thousand and five.<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> And he discoursed about trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon to the hyssop that shoots forth out of the wall; he also discoursed about animals and about birds and about creeping things and about fish.<br><br>
     <sup><b>34</b></sup> And they came from all the peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all the kings of the earth who had heard of his wisdom.<br><br>
