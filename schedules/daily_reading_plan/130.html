  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And Hiram the king of Tyre sent messengers to David, as well as cedar timbers and masons and carpenters to build a house for him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And David perceived that Jehovah had established him as king over Israel <i>and</i> that his kingdom was highly exalted for the sake of His people Israel.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And David took more wives in Jerusalem, and David begot more sons and daughters.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And these are the names of those who were born, whom he had in Jerusalem: Shammua and Shobab and Nathan and Solomon<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And Ibhar and Elishua and Elpelet<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And Nogah and Nepheg and Japhia<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And Elishama and Beeliada and Eliphelet.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> Now when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up in search of David; and David heard <i>of it</i> and went out against them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> And the Philistines came and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> Then David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will You deliver them into my hand? And Jehovah said to him, Go up, and I will deliver them into your hand.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And they went up to Baal-perazim, and David struck them there. And David said, God has broken forth upon my enemies by my hand like the breaking forth of a flood. Therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And they left their gods there; and David gave the order, and they were burned with fire.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> And the Philistines made yet another raid in the valley.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> And David inquired again of God, and God said to him, You shall not go up after them; go around behind them, and come upon them opposite the balsam trees.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then you shall go out to battle; for God will have gone forth before you to strike the army of the Philistines.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And David did as God had commanded him, and they struck down the army of the Philistines from Gibeon even unto Gezer.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> And David’s fame went forth among all the lands, and Jehovah put the fear of him upon all the nations.<br><br>
