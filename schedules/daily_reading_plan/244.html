  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> But now those who are younger than I / Hold me in derision, / Those whose fathers I disdained / To put with the dogs of my flock.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Indeed, what <i>good</i> is the strength of their hands to me? / <i>Their</i> vigor has perished from them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> Withered up through want and hunger, / They gnaw at the dry ground, / A gloom of waste and desolation.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> They pick the mallow upon the bushes, / And the roots of the broom shrub are their food.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> They are driven from the company <i>of men;</i> / <i>Men</i> cry after them as after a thief;<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> So that they must dwell in the most dreadful ravines, / In caves of the earth and in the rocks.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Among the bushes they bray; / Under the nettles they huddle.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> Sons of fools, indeed sons of nameless men, / They have been stricken from the land.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> And now I have become their song, / And I am a byword to them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> They abhor me; they stand aloof from me; / And they do not withhold <i>their</i> spit from my face.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> For He has loosened my cord and afflicted me; / Therefore they have cast off restraint in my presence.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> At my right hand a brood rises up; / They send my feet <i>running</i> / And cast up against me their ways of destruction.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> They break up my path; / They promote my calamity, / Though there is no profit to them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> As through a wide breach they come in; / Amid the ruin they roll on.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> Terrors are turned upon me; / My honor is pursued as by a wind, / And my prosperity passes away like a cloud.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And now my soul is poured out within me; / Days of affliction have taken hold of me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> The night rends my bones from me, / And my gnawing pains do not rest.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> With great force my garments are distorted; / It binds me like the collar of my coat.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> He has cast me into the mire, / And I am like dust and ashes.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> I cry unto You, but You do not answer me; / I stand up, and You stare at me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> You have turned to become cruel to me; / With the might of Your hand You pursue me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> You lift me up into the wind; You make me ride on it; / And You dissolve me in the storm.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> For I know that You will bring me into death, / And to the house appointed for all living.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> Nevertheless does not a man put forth <i>his</i> hand when he falls, / Or because of his disaster therefore cry out?<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> Did I not weep for him who had hard days? / Was my soul not grieved for the needy?<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> When I expected good, evil came; / And when I waited for light, darkness came.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> My inward parts are in turmoil and are not still; / Days of affliction have drawn near to me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> I go about in sunless mourning. / I rise up in the congregation; I cry for help.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> I am a brother to jackals / And a companion to ostriches.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> My skin is black <i>and falling</i> from me, / And my bones burn with heat.<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> My lyre has become mourning, / And my pipe, the voice of those who weep.<br><br>
