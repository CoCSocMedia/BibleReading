  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Give ear, O my people, to my instruction; / Incline your ears to the words of my mouth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> I will open my mouth in a parable; / I will utter riddles from of old,<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> Which we have heard and known, / And our fathers have related to us.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> We will not hide <i>them</i> from their children, / <i>But</i> will relate to the generation to come / The praises of Jehovah and His strength / And His wondrous deeds that He has done.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> Indeed He has established a testimony in Jacob / And appointed a law in Israel, / Which He commanded our fathers / That they should make them known to their children;<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> That the generation to come, / The children to be born, may know <i>them,</i> / <i>Who</i> should arise and relate <i>them</i> to their children;<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> That they might set their hope in God, / And not forget the deeds of God, / But observe His commandments;<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> That they might not be like their fathers, / A stubborn and rebellious generation, / A generation that did not set their heart right, / And whose spirit was not faithful to God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> The children of Ephraim, armed archers with bows, / Turned back in the day of battle.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> They did not keep the covenant of God, / And they refused to walk in His law.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And they forgot His doings / And His wondrous deeds that He had shown them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> He did something wonderful in the sight of their fathers / In the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> He divided the sea and caused them to pass through, / And He made the water stand as a heap.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> And He led them with the cloud by day / And all the night with a light of fire.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> He split rocks in the wilderness / And gave <i>them</i> abundant drink, as from the depths.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> He also brought forth streams from the rock / And made water run down like rivers.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> Yet they still continued to sin against Him, / To rebel against the Most High in the desert.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> And they put God to the test in their heart, / By asking for food according to their desire.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> They also spoke against God; / They said, Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> Behold, He struck the rock, / And water gushed out, / And streams overflowed; / Can He also give <i>us</i> bread, / Or provide meat for His people?<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> Therefore Jehovah heard and was angry. / And a fire was kindled against Jacob, / And also anger went up against Israel;<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> Because they did not believe in God, / And they did not trust in His salvation.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> Yet He commanded the skies above / And opened the doors of heaven;<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> And He rained down upon them manna to eat / And gave them the food of heaven.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> Man ate the bread of the mighty; / He sent them full provision.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> He made the east wind blow in the heavens / And guided the south wind by His strength.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> And He rained upon them meat like dust, / And winged birds like the sand of the seas.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> And He made <i>it</i> fall in the midst of their camp, / Around their habitations.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> So they ate and were well filled; / Indeed what they desired He brought to them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> They were not estranged from what they desired; / Their food was still in their mouths<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> When the anger of God went up against them / And slew <i>some</i> of their fattest ones / And struck down the choice men of Israel.<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> In spite of all this they still sinned / And did not believe in His wondrous deeds.<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> Therefore He consumed their days with vanity, / And their years with terror.<br><br>
     <sup><b>34</b></sup> When He slew them, they inquired after Him, / And they returned and diligently sought God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>35</b></sup> And they remembered that God was their rock, / And the Most High God, their Redeemer.<br><br>
     <sup><b>36</b></sup> But they flattered Him with their mouth / And lied to Him with their tongue.<br><br>
     <sup><b>37</b></sup> For their heart was not steadfast toward Him, / Nor were they faithful to His covenant.<br><br>
     <sup><b>38</b></sup> But He, being merciful, forgave <i>their</i> iniquity / And did not destroy <i>them;</i> / Indeed He turned back His anger many times / And did not stir up all His wrath.<br><br>
     <sup><b>39</b></sup> And He remembered that they were flesh, / A wind that goes away and does not return.<br><br>
     <sup><b>40</b></sup> How often they rebelled against Him in the wilderness / And grieved Him in the desert!<br><br>
     <sup><b>41</b></sup> And they repeatedly put God to the test / And provoked the Holy One of Israel.<br><br>
     <sup><b>42</b></sup> They did not remember His hand, / The day when He ransomed them from the adversary;<br><br>
     <sup><b>43</b></sup> When He set His signs in Egypt / And His wonders in the field of Zoan;<br><br>
     <sup><b>44</b></sup> And He turned their rivers into blood, / As well as their streams, so that they could not drink.<br><br>
     <sup><b>45</b></sup> He sent among them a swarm <i>of</i> <i>flies,</i> which devoured them; / And frogs, which destroyed them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>46</b></sup> And He gave their increase to the consuming locust, / And their labor to the swarming locust.<br><br>
     <sup><b>47</b></sup> He killed their vines with hail, / And their sycamores with ice stones.<br><br>
     <sup><b>48</b></sup> He gave over their cattle also to the hail / And their herds to the lightning bolts.<br><br>
     <sup><b>49</b></sup> He sent among them the burning fierceness of His anger, / Overflowing wrath and indignation and trouble, / A mission of angels of evils.<br><br>
     <sup><b>50</b></sup> He leveled a path for His anger; / He did not spare their soul from death, / But gave their life over to the pestilence.<br><br>
     <sup><b>51</b></sup> And He struck all the firstborn in Egypt, / The firstfruits of their vigor in the tents of Ham.<br><br>
     <sup><b>52</b></sup> But He set forth His people like sheep / And led them like a flock in the wilderness.<br><br>
     <sup><b>53</b></sup> And He led them to safety, so that they did not fear; / But the sea covered their enemies.<br><br>
     <sup><b>54</b></sup> And He brought them forth to His holy border, / The mountain, which His right hand had acquired.<br><br>
     <sup><b>55</b></sup> And He drove out the nations before them / And allotted them as an inheritance by line, / And He made the tribes of Israel dwell <i>there</i> in their tents.<br><br>
     <sup><b>56</b></sup> Yet they put <i>Him</i> to the test and rebelled against God the Most High, / And did not keep His testimonies.<br><br>
     <sup><b>57</b></sup> And they turned back and dealt treacherously, as their fathers <i>had done;</i> / They turned aside like a deceitful bow.<br><br>
     <sup><b>58</b></sup> Indeed they provoked Him to anger with their high places / And made Him jealous with their graven images.<br><br>
     <sup><b>59</b></sup> God heard, and He was angered; / And He greatly abhorred Israel.<br><br>
     <sup><b>60</b></sup> Thus He forsook the tabernacle in Shiloh, / The tent <i>in which</i> He dwelt among men;<br><br>
     <sup><b>61</b></sup> And He gave over His Ark into captivity, / And His glory into the hand of the adversary.<br><br>
     <sup><b>62</b></sup> He also delivered His people to the sword / And was angry with His inheritance.<br><br>
     <sup><b>63</b></sup> Fire devoured their young men, / And their virgins had no marriage song.<br><br>
     <sup><b>64</b></sup> Their priests fell by the sword, / And their widows did not lament.<br><br>
     <sup><b>65</b></sup> Then the Lord awoke as if from sleep, / Like a mighty man who shouts because of wine.<br><br>
     <sup><b>66</b></sup> And He struck His adversaries <i>and sent them</i> back; / He put an everlasting reproach upon them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>67</b></sup> And He rejected the tent of Joseph, / And the tribe of Ephraim He did not choose.<br><br>
     <sup><b>68</b></sup> Rather He chose the tribe of Judah, / Mount Zion, which He loved.<br><br>
     <sup><b>69</b></sup> And He built His sanctuary like the heights, / Like the earth that He has founded forever.<br><br>
     <sup><b>70</b></sup> Moreover He chose David His servant / And took him from the sheepfolds;<br><br>
     <sup><b>71</b></sup> From following after the ewes He brought him / To shepherd Jacob His people / And Israel His inheritance.<br><br>
     <sup><b>72</b></sup> And he shepherded them according to the integrity of his heart, / And guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.<br><br>
