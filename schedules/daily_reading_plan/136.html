  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then at the time of the turn of the year, at the time when kings go forth <i>to battle,</i> Joab led the army and devastated the land of the children of Ammon. And he went and besieged Rabbah while David remained in Jerusalem. And Joab struck Rabbah and overthrew it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And David took the crown of their king from off his head and found <i>it</i> to weigh a talent of gold, and in it were precious stones; and it was <i>put</i> upon David’s head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city, a very great amount.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And he brought out the people who were in it and hewed them with saws and iron cutting tools and axes, and thus did David do to all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Then after this a war arose with the Philistines at Gezer; and Sibbecai the Hushathite slew Sippai, <i>one</i> of the children of the giants; and they were subdued.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And again there was war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, who had six fingers <i>on each hand</i> and six toes <i>on each foot,</i> twenty-four <i>in all;</i> and he also had been born to the giant.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And he defied Israel; and Jonathan the son of Shimea, David’s brother, slew him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> These had been born to the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David and by the hands of his servants.<br><br>
