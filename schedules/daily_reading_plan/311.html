  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Give ear, O God, to my prayer; / And do not hide Yourself from my supplication.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Give heed to me, and answer me. / I grow restless in my complaint and moan,<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> Because of the voice of the enemy, / Because of the oppression of the wicked man; / For they drop iniquity upon me, / And in anger they make me their enemy.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> My heart writhes within me, / And the terrors of death have fallen upon me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> Fear and trembling have come upon me, / And shuddering overwhelms me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And I say, Oh that I had wings like a dove! / Then I would fly away and be at rest.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Indeed I would wander far away; / I would lodge in the wilderness. Selah<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> I would hasten my escape / From the storm wind and the tempest.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> Confuse, O Lord, divide their tongue; / For I have seen violence and contention in the city.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> Day and night they go around it, / Upon its walls; / And iniquity and trouble are in the midst of it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> Utter ruin is in the midst of it, / And oppression and deceit / Do not depart from its streets.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> For it is not an enemy who reproaches me; / Otherwise I could bear it. / It is not he who hates me who magnifies himself against me; / Otherwise I could hide myself from him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> But it is you, my equal, / My close friend and my acquaintance.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> We were in sweet counsel together; / We walked with the throng in the house of God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> Let death surprise them; / May they go down into Sheol alive. / For evil is in their dwelling, in the midst of them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> As for me, I call out to God, / And Jehovah will save me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> Evening and morning and at noontime / I complain and moan, / And He hears my voice.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> He has redeemed my soul in peace / From the battle against me, / For many are they <i>who strive</i> with me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> God hears and answers them — / Even He who sits <i>enthroned</i> from of old — Selah / Because with them there is no change, / And they do not fear God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> He put forth his hands against those who were at peace with him; / He profaned his covenant.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> Smooth were the buttery words of his mouth, / But his heart was war; / More soothing than oil were his words, / But they were <i>in fact</i> drawn swords.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> Cast your burden upon Jehovah, / And He will sustain you; / He will never allow the righteous to be moved.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> But You, O God, will bring them down / Into the pit of decay.Men of bloodshed and deceit / Will not live out half their days; / But I will trust in You.<br><br>
