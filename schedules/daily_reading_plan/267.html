  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God,<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Even as it is written in Isaiah the prophet: “Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who will prepare Your way,<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> A voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord; make straight His paths.”<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> John came baptizing in the wilderness and preaching a baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And all the region of Judea went out to him, and all the people of Jerusalem; and they were baptized by him in the Jordan River, as they confessed their sins.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And John was clothed in camel’s hair and had a leather girdle around his loins, and he ate locusts and wild honey.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And he preached, saying, He who is stronger than I comes after me, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> I have baptized you in water, but He Himself will baptize you in the Holy Spirit.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> And in those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized in the Jordan by John.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And immediately, coming up out of the water, He saw the heavens being parted and the Spirit as a dove descending upon Him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And a voice came out of the heavens: You are My Son, the Beloved; in You I have found My delight.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And immediately the Spirit thrust Him out into the wilderness.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> And He was in the wilderness forty days, being tempted by Satan; and He was with the wild animals, and the angels ministered to Him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> And after John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the gospel of God,<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And saying, The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God has drawn near. Repent and believe in the gospel.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And passing beside the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew, Simon’s brother, casting a net in the sea, for they were fishermen.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> And Jesus said to them, Come after Me, and I will cause you to become fishers of men.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> And immediately leaving the nets, they followed Him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> And going on a little, He saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, who also were in their boat, mending the nets.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> And immediately He called them, and leaving their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, they went after Him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And they went into Capernaum, and immediately, on the Sabbath, He entered into the synagogue and taught.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> And they were astounded at His teaching, for He taught them as One having authority and not like the scribes.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> And immediately, there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out, saying,<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> What have we to do with You, Jesus, Nazarene? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are — the Holy One of God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be quiet and come out of him!<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> And the unclean spirit, convulsing him and shouting with a loud voice, came out of him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> And they were all amazed, so that they discussed among themselves, saying, What is this? A new teaching! With authority He orders even the unclean spirits, and they obey Him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> And immediately the report concerning Him went out everywhere into all the surrounding region of Galilee.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> And immediately, going out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew with James and John.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> And Simon’s mother-in-law was lying down with a fever, and immediately they told Him about her.<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> And He came to her and raised her up, holding her hand, and the fever left her, and she served them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> And when evening fell and the sun had set, they brought to Him all those who were ill and those who were demon-possessed.<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> And the whole city was gathered together at the door.<br><br>
     <sup><b>34</b></sup> And He healed many who were ill with various diseases, and He cast out many demons and did not allow the demons to speak, because they knew Him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>35</b></sup> And rising very early in the morning, while it was still night, He went out and went away to a deserted place, and there He prayed.<br><br>
     <sup><b>36</b></sup> And Simon and those with him hunted for Him,<br><br>
     <sup><b>37</b></sup> And they found Him and said to Him, All are seeking You.<br><br>
     <sup><b>38</b></sup> And He said to them, Let us go elsewhere into the nearby towns that I may preach there also, because for this purpose I came out.<br><br>
     <sup><b>39</b></sup> And He went preaching in their synagogues in the whole of Galilee and casting out the demons.<br><br>
     <sup><b>40</b></sup> And a leper came to Him, entreating Him and falling on his knees and saying to Him, If You are willing, You can cleanse me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>41</b></sup> And He was moved with compassion, and stretching out His hand, He touched him and said to him, I am willing; be cleansed!<br><br>
     <sup><b>42</b></sup> And immediately the leprosy left him, and he was cleansed.<br><br>
     <sup><b>43</b></sup> And sternly charging him, immediately He thrust him out,<br><br>
     <sup><b>44</b></sup> And said to him, See that you say nothing to anyone; but go, show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>45</b></sup> But he went out and began to proclaim it much and to spread the matter abroad, so that He could no longer enter openly into a city, but He stayed outside in deserted places. And they came to Him from everywhere. <br><br>
