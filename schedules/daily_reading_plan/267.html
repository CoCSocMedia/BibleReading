  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And on the day that Moses had finished setting up the tabernacle, and had anointed it and sanctified it and all its furnishings and the altar and all its utensils, and had anointed them and sanctified them,<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> The leaders of Israel, the heads of their fathers’ households (they were the leaders of the tribes, who were over those who had been numbered), presented <i>their offering.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And they brought their offering before Jehovah: six covered wagons and twelve oxen, a wagon for <i>every</i> two of the leaders and an ox for each one; and they presented them before the tabernacle.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> Take <i>these</i> from them that they may be used in doing the service of the Tent of Meeting; and you shall give them to the Levites, to each according to his service.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them to the Levites.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Two wagons and four oxen he gave to the sons of Gershon according to their service;<br><br>

     <sup><b>9</b></sup> But to the sons of Kohath he gave none, because the service of the sanctuary belonged to them; they bore <i>this</i> upon their shoulder.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And the leaders presented <i>offerings</i> for the dedication of the altar in the day that it was anointed; that is, the leaders presented their offering before the altar.<br><br>
