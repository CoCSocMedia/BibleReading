  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said,<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> How long will you hunt for words? / Consider, and afterward we will speak.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> Why are we considered <i>to be</i> like beasts / And have become unclean in your eyes?<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> You who tear yourself in your anger, / Will the earth be forsaken for your sake, / Or will the rock be removed from its place?<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> Indeed the light of the wicked goes out, / And the flame of his fire does not shine.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> The light is darkness in his tent, / And his lamp above him goes out.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> The steps of his strength are confined, / And his counsel has cast him down.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> For he has been cast into a net by his own feet, / And he walks about on the webbing of a pitfall.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> A snare grabs <i>him</i> by the heel; / A trap lays hold on him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> A rope is hidden for him on the ground, / And a trap for him, on the path.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> Terrors frighten him all around / And chase him at his heels.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> His strength is famished, / And calamity is prepared at his side.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> It devours the members of his body; / The firstborn of death devours his members.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> He is rooted out of his tent, in which he trusts; / And he is made to march to the king of terrors.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> That which is not his dwells in his tent; / Brimstone is scattered upon his habitation.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> Beneath, his roots are dried up; / And above, his branch is withered.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> The memory of him perishes from the earth, / And he has no name on the open plain.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> He is thrust out from the light to the darkness / And driven from the world.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> He has no posterity and no progeny among his people, / And there are none remaining where he sojourned.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> Those who come after will be astonished at his day, / As those who went before were horrified.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> Surely these are the dwellings of the unjust, / And this is the place of him who does not know God.<br><br>
