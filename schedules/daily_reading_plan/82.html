  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And at that moment there came a man of God from Judah by the word of Jehovah to Bethel while Jeroboam was standing at the altar to burn incense.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And he cried out against the altar by the word of Jehovah and said, Altar, O altar, thus says Jehovah: Behold, a son shall be born to the house of David, Josiah by name; and he will sacrifice upon you the priests of the high places who burn incense upon you, and men’s bones will they burn upon you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And he gave a sign that day, saying, This is the sign that Jehovah has spoken: The altar here will be torn apart, and the ashes that are upon it will be poured out.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And when the king heard the word of the man of God that he cried out against the altar in Bethel, Jeroboam stretched out his hand from over the altar, saying, Lay hold of him! And his hand, which he had stretched out against him, withered, and he could not draw it back to himself.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And the altar was torn apart, and the ashes were poured forth from the altar, according to the sign that the man of God had given by the word of Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And the king responded and said to the man of God, Entreat Jehovah your God, I beg you, and intercede for me that my hand may be restored to me. And the man of God entreated Jehovah, and the king’s hand was restored to him as it had been formerly.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Then the king said to the man of God, Come home with me, and have something to eat; and I will give you a gift.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> But the man of God said to the king, If you gave me half your household, I would not go with you; and I will not eat food nor drink water in this place;<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> For thus was I commanded by the word of Jehovah, saying, You shall not eat food nor drink water, nor shall you return by the way that you came.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> So he went by another way and did not return by the way that he came to Bethel.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> Now there was a certain old prophet dwelling in Bethel. And his sons came and related to him all the things that the man of God had done that day in Bethel; the words that he had spoken to the king, they also related to their father.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And their father said to them, Which way did he go? Now his sons had seen which way the man of God, who came from Judah, had gone.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> And he said to his sons, Saddle the donkey for me. So they saddled the donkey for him, and he rode on it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> And he went after the man of God and found him sitting under a terebinth. And he said to him, Are you the man of God who came from Judah? And he said, I am.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And he said to him, Come home with me, and eat some food.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> But he said, I cannot return with you and go with you; neither will I eat food nor drink water with you in this place.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> For I was told by the word of Jehovah, You shall not eat food nor drink water there, nor shall you return by going on the way that you came there.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> And <i>the old man</i> said, I also am a prophet like you, and an angel has spoken to me by the word of Jehovah, saying, Bring him back with you to your house that he may eat food and drink water. He lied to him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> So he returned with him and ate food in his house and drank water.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> And while they were sitting at the table, the word of Jehovah came to the prophet who brought him back;<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And he cried out to the man of God who came from Judah, saying, Thus says Jehovah, Because you have rebelled against the word of Jehovah and did not keep the command that Jehovah your God commanded you,<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> But returned and ate food and drank water in the place concerning which He said to you, Do not eat food and do not drink water; your corpse shall not come to the grave of your fathers.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> And after he had eaten food and had drunk <i>water,</i> <i>the old man</i> saddled the donkey for him, <i>that is,</i> for the prophet whom he had brought back.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> And as he went, a lion met him on the way and killed him. And his corpse was thrown on the road, and the donkey stood beside it; the lion stood beside the corpse also.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> And some men soon passed by and saw the corpse thrown on the road and the lion standing beside the corpse, and they went and told <i>it</i> in the city where the old prophet dwelt.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> And when the prophet who had brought him back from the way heard <i>it,</i> he said, It is the man of God, who rebelled against the word of Jehovah; and Jehovah has given him to the lion, which tore him apart and killed him, according to the word of Jehovah which He spoke to him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> Then he spoke to his sons, saying, Saddle the donkey for me; and they saddled <i>it.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> And he went and found his corpse thrown on the road and the donkey and the lion standing beside the corpse; the lion had not eaten the corpse, nor had it torn the donkey apart.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> And the prophet took up the corpse of the man of God and laid it on the donkey and brought it back; and it was brought to the city of the old prophet for mourning and for burial.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> And he laid his corpse in his own grave and mourned over him, <i>saying,</i> Alas, my brother!<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> And after he had buried him, he spoke to his sons, saying, When I die, bury me in the grave where the man of God is buried; beside his bones lay my bones.<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> For the word that he cried out by the word of Jehovah against the altar that is in Bethel and against all the houses of the high places that are in the cities of Samaria shall surely come to pass.<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> After this matter Jeroboam did not turn from his evil way, but he again made priests for the high places from among the people; whoever desired <i>it,</i> he consecrated to be priests of the high places.<br><br>
     <sup><b>34</b></sup> And this matter became a sin to the house of Jeroboam, so as even to cut <i>it</i> off and destroy <i>it</i> from the face of the earth.<br><br>
