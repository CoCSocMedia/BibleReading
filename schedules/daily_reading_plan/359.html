  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Bless Jehovah, O my soul; / And all that is within me, <i>bless</i> His holy name.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Bless Jehovah, O my soul; / And do not forget all His benefits:<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> He pardons all your iniquities; / He heals all your diseases;<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> He redeems your life from the pit; / He crowns you with lovingkindness and compassions;<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> He satisfies the prime of your life with good, / <i>So that</i> your youth is renewed like the eagle.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> Jehovah executes righteous acts, / And judgments for all who are oppressed.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> He made His ways known to Moses; / His acts, to the children of Israel.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> Jehovah is compassionate and gracious, / Long-suffering and abundant in lovingkindness.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> He will not always contend <i>with us,</i> / Nor will He keep <i>His</i> <i>anger</i> forever.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> He has not dealt with us according to our sins, / Nor has He recompensed us according to our iniquities.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> For as high as the heavens are above the earth, / So great is His lovingkindness upon those who fear Him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> As far as the east is from the west, / So far has He removed our transgressions from us.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> As compassionate as a father is toward <i>his</i> children, / So compassionate is Jehovah toward those who fear Him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> For He knows our frame; / He remembers that we are dust.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> Man — his days are like grass; / He flourishes like a field flower:<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> For the wind passes over it, and it is no more; / And its own place knows of it no longer.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> But Jehovah’s lovingkindness is from eternity / Unto eternity upon those who fear Him, / And His righteousness is to the children’s children;<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> To those who keep His covenant / And remember His precepts so as to do them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> Jehovah has established His throne in the heavens, / And His kingdom rules over all.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> Bless Jehovah, you His angels, / Who are mighty in strength to perform His word, / By obeying the voice of His word.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> Bless Jehovah, all you His hosts, / You His ministers who execute His will.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> Bless Jehovah, all you His works, / In all places of His dominion. / Bless Jehovah, O my soul.<br><br>
