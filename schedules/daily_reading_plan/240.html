  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then Job answered and said,<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> How you have helped him who is without power! / How you have saved the arm of him who is without strength!<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> How you have counseled him who is without wisdom / And have plentifully declared sound knowledge!<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> To whom have you uttered words? / And whose spirit has come forth from you?<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> The deceased are made to tremble / Beneath the waters, and those who inhabit them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> Sheol is naked before Him, / And Abaddon has no covering.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> He stretches out the north over the void; / He hangs the earth upon nothing.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> He binds up the waters in His thick clouds, / And the cloud is not rent under them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> He covers the face of <i>His</i> throne; / He spreads His cloud over it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> He drew a circle on the surface of the waters / As a boundary of the light and the darkness.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> The pillars of heaven shook / And were astounded at His rebuke.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> By His power He stilled the sea, / And by His understanding He struck down Rahab.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> By His Spirit the heavens became beauty; / His hand pierced the fleeing serpent.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> Indeed, these are but the fringes of His ways; / And how small a whisper do we hear of Him! / But as for the thundering of His mightiness, who can comprehend <i>it?</i><br><br>
