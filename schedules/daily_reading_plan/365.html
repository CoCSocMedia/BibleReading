  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> O God of my praise, do not be silent;<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> For the mouth of the wicked man and the mouth of deceit are opened against me; / They speak to me with a lying tongue.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And with words of hatred they have surrounded me / And have fought against me without cause.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> In return for my love they have become my adversaries, / But I am <i>all</i> prayer.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And they have set against me evil in return for good / And hatred in return for my love.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> Appoint a wicked man over him, / And let an adversary stand at his right hand.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> When he is judged, let him come forth wicked; / And let his prayer be counted as sin.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> May his days be few; / May another take his office.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> May his children be orphans, / And his wife a widow.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And may his children wander all about and beg, / And may they seek <i>food</i> far from their desolated ruins.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> May the creditor seize all that he has, / And may strangers plunder the fruit of his labor.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> May there be no one to extend him mercy, / Nor anyone to be kind to his orphans.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> May his posterity be cut off; / In the generation following may his name be blotted out.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> May his fathers’ iniquity be remembered before Jehovah, / And may his mother’s sin not be blotted out.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> May they be before Jehovah continually, / So that He may cut off the memory of them from the earth;<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> Because he did not remember to show lovingkindness, / But persecuted the poor and needy and brokenhearted, / To put <i>them</i> to death.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> Indeed he loved cursing, so it came on him; / And he took no delight in blessing, so it was far from him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> And he clothed himself with cursing like his garment, / So it came into his inward parts like water / And into his bones like oil.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> Let it be to him like the cloak that he wraps around himself, / And as a belt with which he constantly girds himself.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> This is the reward from Jehovah for my adversaries / And for those who speak evil against my soul.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> But You, O Jehovah Lord, deal with me, / For Your name’s sake; / Because Your lovingkindness is good, deliver me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> For I am poor and needy, / And my heart is wounded within me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> I am gone like a shadow that declines; / I am shaken off like the locust.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> My knees wobble through fasting, / And my flesh has become lean, without fatness.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> I have also become a reproach to them: / When they see me, they shake their heads.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> Help me, O Jehovah my God; / Save me according to Your lovingkindness;<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> And they will know that this is Your hand, / <i>That</i> it is You, O Jehovah, who have done it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> Let them curse, but You bless; / When they arise, they will be put to shame, / And Your servant will rejoice.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> May my adversaries be clothed with humiliation, / And may they wrap themselves with their own shame as with a mantle.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> I will give much thanks to Jehovah with my mouth, / And in the midst of the multitude I will praise Him;<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> For He stands at the right hand of the needy / To save <i>him</i> from those who judge his soul.<br><br>
