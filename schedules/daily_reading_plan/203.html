  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Now these are the priests and the Levites who went up with Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra,<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Amariah, Malluch, Hattush,<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> Shecaniah, Rehum, Meremoth,<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Iddo, Ginnethoi, Abijah,<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> Mijamin, Maadiah, Bilgah,<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> Shemaiah, and Joiarib, Jedaiah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, Jedaiah. These were the heads of the priests and of their brothers in the days of Jeshua.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And the Levites: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, <i>and</i> Mattaniah, who was over the thanksgiving, he and his brothers.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> And Bakbukiah and Unno, their brothers, were opposite them, by <i>their</i> service groups.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And Jeshua begot Joiakim, and Joiakim begot Eliashib, and Eliashib <i>begot</i> Joiada,<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And Joiada begot Jonathan, and Jonathan begot Jaddua.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And in the days of Joiakim, the priests, the heads of fathers’ <i>houses,</i> were: of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah;<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> Of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan;<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> Of Malluchi, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph;<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> Of Harim, Adna; of Meraioth, Helkai;<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> Of Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam;<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> Of Abijah, Zichri; of Miniamin, of Moadiah, Piltai;<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> Of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jehonathan;<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> And of Joiarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi;<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> Of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber;<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> Of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethanel.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> As for the Levites, in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan and Jaddua, the heads of fathers’ <i>houses</i> were recorded, as well as the priests, in the reign of Darius the Persian.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> The sons of Levi, the heads of fathers’ <i>houses,</i> were written in the book of the chronicles until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> And the heads of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brothers opposite them, to praise and give thanks, according to the commandment of David the man of God, service group next to service group.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> Mattaniah and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub were gatekeepers keeping the watch at the storehouses of the gates.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor and of Ezra the priest, the scribe.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites from all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem in order to hold the dedication with rejoicing and thanksgiving and singing with cymbals, harps, and lyres.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> So the sons of the singers gathered together from the plain around Jerusalem and from the villages of the Netophathites<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> And from Beth-gilgal and from the fields of Geba and Azmaveth; for the singers had built outlying villages for themselves around Jerusalem.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> And the priests and the Levites purified themselves; and they purified the people and the gates and the wall.<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> Then I brought the leaders of Judah up onto the wall and appointed two great companies that gave thanks and went in procession. <i>One went</i> to the right upon the wall toward the Dung Gate;<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> And after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the leaders of Judah,<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> And Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,<br><br>
     <sup><b>34</b></sup> Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,<br><br>
     <sup><b>35</b></sup> And some of the priests’ sons with trumpets: Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph;<br><br>
     <sup><b>36</b></sup> And his brothers, Shemaiah and Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God; and Ezra the scribe was before them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>37</b></sup> And at the Fountain Gate, and straight in front of them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the ascent of the wall, above the house of David, to the Water Gate on the east.<br><br>
     <sup><b>38</b></sup> And the second company that gave thanks went to meet <i>them,</i> and I after them, with half of the people, upon the wall, above the Tower of the Furnaces, to the Broad Wall,<br><br>
     <sup><b>39</b></sup> And above the Gate of Ephraim, and by the Old Gate, and by the Fish Gate and the Tower of Hananel and the Tower of the Hundred, to the Sheep Gate; and they stopped at the Gate of the Guard.<br><br>
     <sup><b>40</b></sup> So the two companies that gave thanks stood in the house of God, as well as I and half of the rulers with me;<br><br>
     <sup><b>41</b></sup> And the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;<br><br>
     <sup><b>42</b></sup> And Maaseiah and Shemaiah and Eleazar and Uzzi and Jehohanan and Malchijah and Elam and Ezer. And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah <i>as</i> the overseer.<br><br>
     <sup><b>43</b></sup> And they offered great sacrifices that day and rejoiced, for God had caused them to rejoice greatly; and the women and children also rejoiced. And the joy of Jerusalem was heard from afar.<br><br>
     <sup><b>44</b></sup> And on that day men were appointed over the chambers for the stores, for the heave offerings, for the firstfruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them, according to the cities’ fields, the portions assigned by the law for the priests and the Levites, for Judah rejoiced over the priests and Levites who served.<br><br>
     <sup><b>45</b></sup> And they kept the charge of their God and the charge of the purification, as did the singers and the gatekeepers, according to the command of David <i>and</i> Solomon his son.<br><br>
     <sup><b>46</b></sup> For in the days of David and Asaph, long ago, there were leaders of the singers, and <i>there were</i> songs of praise and thanksgiving to God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>47</b></sup> And in the days of Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah all Israel gave the portions for the singers and the gatekeepers as each day required; and they consecrated <i>portions</i> for the Levites, and the Levites consecrated <i>portions</i> for the sons of Aaron.<br><br>
