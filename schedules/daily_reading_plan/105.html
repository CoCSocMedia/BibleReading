  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> In the second year of Joash the son of Joahaz, the king of Israel, Amaziah the son of Joash, the king of Judah, began to reign.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem for twenty-nine years; and his mother’s name was Jehoaddin of Jerusalem.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And he did what was right in the sight of Jehovah, yet not like David his father; he did according to all that Joash his father had done.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> However the high places were not removed; the people still sacrificed and burned incense in the high places.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And when the kingdom was established in his hand, he struck down his servants who had struck down his father the king.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> But the children of the murderers he did not put to death, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, in which Jehovah commanded, saying, Fathers shall not be put to death because of <i>their</i> children, nor shall children be put to death because of <i>their</i> fathers; but every man shall be put to death for his <i>own</i> sin.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> He struck ten thousand <i>of</i> Edom in the Valley of Salt; and he captured Sela in battle and called the name of it Joktheel, <i>as it is</i> to this day.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu, the king of Israel, saying, Come, let us confront each other.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> And Jehoash the king of Israel sent <i>word</i> to Amaziah the king of Judah, saying, The thornbush that was in Lebanon sent <i>word</i> to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give your daughter to my son as <i>his</i> wife; but a wild beast that was in Lebanon passed by and trampled the thornbush.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> You have surely struck Edom, and your heart has lifted you up. Glorify yourself, but remain in your home. Why should you stir up trouble so that you and Judah with you fall?<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> But Amaziah would not listen; so Jehoash the king of Israel went up, and he and Amaziah the king of Judah confronted each other in Beth-shemesh, which belongs to Judah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And Judah was defeated before Israel, and they fled, each man to his tent.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> And Jehoash the king of Israel captured Amaziah the king of Judah the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah in Beth-shemesh; and he came to Jerusalem and tore down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate, four hundred cubits.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> And he took all the gold and silver and all the vessels that were found in the house of Jehovah and in the treasuries of the king’s house as well as hostages, and returned to Samaria.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did and his might and how he fought with Amaziah the king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And Jehoash slept with his fathers and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel. And Jeroboam his son reigned in his place.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> And Amaziah the son of Joash, the king of Judah, lived for fifteen years after the death of Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz, the king of Israel.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> And the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> And they formed a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish; and they sent <i>men</i> after him to Lachish, and they killed him there.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> And they brought him on horses, and he was buried in Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And all the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in place of his father Amaziah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> It was he who built Elath and restored it to Judah after <i>Amaziah</i> the king slept with his fathers.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash, the king of Judah, Jeroboam the son of Joash, the king of Israel, began to reign in Samaria; <i>he reigned</i> forty-one years.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> And he did what was evil in the sight of Jehovah; he did not turn away from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, by which he caused Israel to sin.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> He restored the border of Israel from the entrance of Hamath to the sea of the Arabah, according to the word of Jehovah the God of Israel, which He spoke through His servant Jonah the son of Amittai, the prophet who was of Gath-hepher.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> For Jehovah saw the affliction of Israel, <i>that it was</i> very bitter, for there was neither bond nor free <i>left,</i> nor was there anyone to help Israel.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> And Jehovah did not say that He would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven but saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam and all that he did and his might, how he warred and how he restored for Israel Damascus and Hamath, which had belonged to Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, with the kings of Israel. And Zechariah his son reigned in his place.<br><br>
