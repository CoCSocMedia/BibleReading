  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> I made a covenant with my eyes; / How then can I gaze upon a virgin?<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> What then is the portion from God above, / Or the inheritance of the Almighty on high?<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> Is it not calamity for the unjust / And misfortune for the workers of iniquity?<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Does He not see my ways / And count all my steps?<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> If I have walked with falsehood, / And my foot has hastened after deceit —<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> Let Him weigh me in a righteous balance, / And let God know my integrity —<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> If my step has turned from the way, / And my heart has gone after my own eyes, / And if any spot has stuck to my hands;<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> May I sow and another eat; / Indeed may my produce be rooted up.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> If my heart has been enticed into <i>following</i> after a woman, / Or I have lain in wait at my neighbor’s door;<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> May my wife grind for another, / And may others kneel over her.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> For that would have been a heinous act, / And it would be wickedness, <i>to be punished</i> by the judges.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> For it is a fire that devours to Abaddon / And would root up all my increase.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> If I have despised the cause of my servant or my maid / When they contended with me,<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> What then will I do when God rises up? / And when He visits me, what will I answer Him?<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> Did not He who made me in the womb make him? / And was it not One who fashioned us in the womb?<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> If I have withheld the poor from <i>their</i> desire, / Or have let the eyes of the widow fail,<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> Or have eaten my morsel alone / Without the orphan eating of it —<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> Rather, from my youth he grew up with me as with a father, / And from my mother’s womb I guided the widow —<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> If I have seen someone perishing from lack of clothing / Or that the needy had no covering;<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> If his loins have not blessed me, / And he has not been made warm with the fleece of my sheep;<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> If I have raised my hand against the orphan / Because I saw that I had support <i>among those</i> in the gate;<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> May my shoulder blade fall from the shoulder, / And may my arm be broken at the elbow.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> For calamity from God is dreadful to me, / And because of His majesty I can do nothing.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> If I have made gold my hope, / And have called fine gold my confidence;<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> If I have rejoiced because my wealth was great / And because my hand had acquired much;<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> If I have looked at the sun when it shone / Or the moon going on in splendor,<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> And my heart has been secretly enticed, / And my mouth has kissed my hand;<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> It too would be wickedness, <i>to be punished</i> by the judges, / For I would have denied God above.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> If I have rejoiced at the misfortune of him who hated me, / Or have exulted when evil found him —<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> Rather, I have not allowed my mouth to sin / By asking for his life with a curse —<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> If the men of my tent have not said, / Who can find one who has not been filled with our master’s meat? —<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> The sojourner has not lodged in the street; / I have opened my doors to the highway —<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> If I have covered my transgressions as Adam did / By hiding my iniquity in my bosom,<br><br>
     <sup><b>34</b></sup> Because I so dreaded the great multitude, / And the contempt of the families so frightened me, / That I was silent and did not go out <i>my</i> door —<br><br>
     <sup><b>35</b></sup> Oh, that I had someone to hear me! / Here is my signature! Let the Almighty answer me. / And let my accuser write up the charge.<br><br>
     <sup><b>36</b></sup> Surely I would carry it on my shoulder; / I would bind it onto me like a crown;<br><br>
     <sup><b>37</b></sup> I would declare to Him the number of my steps; / Like a prince I would approach Him!<br><br>
     <sup><b>38</b></sup> If my land cries out against me, / And its furrows weep together;<br><br>
     <sup><b>39</b></sup> If I have eaten its strength without money, / And have caused its owners to lose <i>their</i> life;<br><br>
     <sup><b>40</b></sup> May thorns come forth instead of wheat, / And pungent weeds instead of barley. / The words of Job are ended.<br><br>
