  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> I will bless Jehovah at all times; / His praise will continually be in my mouth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> My soul makes its boast in Jehovah; / The lowly hear and they rejoice.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> Magnify Jehovah with me, / And let us exalt His name together.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> I sought Jehovah, and He answered me; / And He delivered me from all that terrified me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> They looked to Him and were radiant; / And their faces will never be abashed.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> This poor man called out, and Jehovah heard; / And He saved him out of all his troubles.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> The angel of Jehovah encamps / Around those who fear Him, and He delivers them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> Taste and see that Jehovah is good; / Blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> Fear Jehovah, you <i>who are</i> His saints; / For there is no lack with those who fear Him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> The young lions hunger and starve, / But those who seek Jehovah will not lack any good thing.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> Come, children; hear me. / I will teach you the fear of Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> Who is the man who desires life, / Who loves <i>having</i> days in order to see good?<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> Guard your tongue from evil, / And your lips from speaking deceit.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> Turn away from evil and do good; / Seek peace and pursue it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> The eyes of Jehovah <i>are set</i> toward the righteous, / And His ears, toward their cry.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> The face of Jehovah is against those who do evil, / To cut off the memory of them from the earth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> <i>The righteous</i> cry out, and Jehovah hears; / And He saves them out of all their troubles.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> Jehovah is near to those who are broken in heart, / And He saves those who are contrite in spirit.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> Many are the troubles of the righteous man, / But Jehovah delivers him from all of them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> He keeps all his bones; / Not one of them is broken.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> Evil will slay the wicked, / And those who hate the righteous man will be condemned.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> Jehovah redeems the soul of His servants, / And none who take refuge in Him will be condemned.<br><br>
