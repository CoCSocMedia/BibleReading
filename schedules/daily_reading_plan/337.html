  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Sing for joy to God our strength; / Make a joyful noise to the God of Jacob.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Lift up a song and sound the tambourine, / The pleasant lyre with the harp.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> Blow the trumpet at the new moon, / At the full moon, on our feast day.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> For that is a statute of Israel, / An ordinance of the God of Jacob.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> He appointed it as a testimony in Joseph / When He went out over the land of Egypt. / I heard a language that I did not know:<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> I turned your shoulder from the burden; / Your hands were freed from the basket.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> You called in trouble, and I delivered you; / I answered you from the secret place of thunder; / I proved you at the waters of Meribah. Selah<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> Hear, O My people, and I will testify against you: / O Israel, if you would listen to Me!<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> There shall be no strange god among you, / Neither shall you worship any foreign god.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> I am Jehovah your God, / Who brought you up out of the land of Egypt; / Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> But My people did not listen to My voice, / And Israel would not consent to Me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> So I gave them over to the stubbornness of their heart: / They walked after their own counsels.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> Oh that My people had listened to Me, / That Israel had walked in My ways!<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> I would have soon subdued their enemies / And turned My hand against their adversaries.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> Those who hate Jehovah would have come cringing to Him, / And their time would be forever.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And He would have fed them with the finest of wheat; / Indeed with honey from the rock I would have satisfied you.<br><br>
