  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Blessed are those whose way is perfect, / Who walk in the law of Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Blessed are those who keep His testimonies, / Who seek Him with all <i>their</i> heart.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> Surely they do no wrong; / They walk in His ways.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> You have commanded <i>that</i> Your precepts / Be diligently kept.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> Oh that my ways may be established / So as to keep Your statutes!<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> Then I will not be put to shame, / When I regard all Your commandments.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> I will give thanks to You with uprightness of heart / When I learn Your righteous ordinances.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> I will keep Your statutes; / Do not utterly forsake me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> With what should a young man keep his way pure? / By guarding <i>it</i> according to Your word.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> With all my heart I have sought You; / Do not let me wander from Your commandments.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> In my heart I have treasured up Your word / That I might not sin against You.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> Blessed are You, O Jehovah; / Teach me Your statutes.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> With my lips I have declared / All the ordinances of Your mouth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> I have rejoiced in the way of Your testimonies / As much as in all riches.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> I will muse upon Your precepts / And regard Your ways.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> I will take delight in Your statutes; / I will not forget Your word.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> Deal bountifully with Your servant that I may live / And keep Your word.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> Open my eyes that I may behold / Wondrous things out of Your law.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> I am a sojourner in the earth; / Do not hide Your commandments from me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> My soul is crushed with longing / For Your ordinances at all times.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> You have rebuked the proud, the cursed, / Who wander from Your commandments.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> Roll away from me reproach and contempt, / For I have kept Your testimonies.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> Princes as well have sat and spoken against me, / <i>But</i> Your servant mused upon Your statutes.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> Also Your testimonies are my delight; / <i>They are</i> my counselors.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> My soul clings to the dust; / Enliven me according to Your word.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> I have recounted my ways, and You have answered me; / Teach me Your statutes.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> Cause me to understand the way of Your precepts, / And I will muse upon Your wondrous deeds.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> My soul melts because of grief; / Strengthen me according to Your word.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> Remove from me the way of falsehood, / And graciously grant me Your law.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> I have chosen the way of faithfulness; / Your ordinances I have set <i>before me.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> I cling to Your testimonies; / O Jehovah, do not put me to shame.<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> I run the way of Your commandments, / For You enlarge my heart.<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> Teach me, O Jehovah, the way of Your statutes; / And I will keep it to the end.<br><br>
     <sup><b>34</b></sup> Give me understanding, and I will observe Your law; / Indeed I will keep it with all <i>my</i> heart.<br><br>
     <sup><b>35</b></sup> Cause me to go on the path of Your commandments, / For in it I delight.<br><br>
     <sup><b>36</b></sup> Incline my heart to Your testimonies / And not to unjust gain.<br><br>
     <sup><b>37</b></sup> Turn my eyes from beholding vanity, / And enliven me in Your ways.<br><br>
     <sup><b>38</b></sup> Confirm to Your servant Your word, / Which is for fearing You.<br><br>
     <sup><b>39</b></sup> Turn away my reproach, which I fear; / For Your ordinances are good.<br><br>
     <sup><b>40</b></sup> Behold, I have longed after Your precepts; / Enliven me in Your righteousness.<br><br>
     <sup><b>41</b></sup> May Your lovingkindness also come to me, O Jehovah, / Your salvation according to Your word.<br><br>
     <sup><b>42</b></sup> Thus I will have an answer for him who reproaches me, / For I trust in Your word.<br><br>
     <sup><b>43</b></sup> And do not take the word of truth utterly from my mouth, / For I have hoped in Your ordinances.<br><br>
     <sup><b>44</b></sup> Thus I will keep Your law continually, / Forever and ever.<br><br>
     <sup><b>45</b></sup> And I will walk at liberty, / For I have sought Your precepts.<br><br>
     <sup><b>46</b></sup> I will also speak of Your testimonies before kings / And not be ashamed.<br><br>
     <sup><b>47</b></sup> And I will take delight in Your commandments, / Which I love.<br><br>
     <sup><b>48</b></sup> And I will lift up my hand to Your commandments, which I love; / And I will muse upon Your statutes.<br><br>
     <sup><b>49</b></sup> Remember the word to Your servant / In which You have made me hope.<br><br>
     <sup><b>50</b></sup> This is my comfort in my affliction, / For Your word has enlivened me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>51</b></sup> The proud have derided me greatly; / I have not swerved from Your law.<br><br>
     <sup><b>52</b></sup> I have remembered Your ordinances from long ago, / O Jehovah, and have comforted myself.<br><br>
     <sup><b>53</b></sup> Raging indignation seizes me because of the wicked, / Who forsake Your law.<br><br>
     <sup><b>54</b></sup> Your statutes have become my songs of praise / In the house of my pilgrimage.<br><br>
     <sup><b>55</b></sup> I have remembered Your name / In the night, O Jehovah, / And have kept Your law.<br><br>
     <sup><b>56</b></sup> This has been mine, / That I have kept Your precepts.<br><br>
     <sup><b>57</b></sup> Jehovah is my portion; / I have promised to keep Your words.<br><br>
     <sup><b>58</b></sup> I entreated Your favor with <i>my</i> whole heart; / Be gracious to me according to Your word.<br><br>
     <sup><b>59</b></sup> I considered my ways / And turned my feet toward Your testimonies.<br><br>
     <sup><b>60</b></sup> I hurried and did not delay / To keep Your commandments.<br><br>
     <sup><b>61</b></sup> The cords of the wicked surround me, / <i>But</i> I have not forgotten Your law.<br><br>
     <sup><b>62</b></sup> At midnight I rise up to give thanks to You / Because of Your righteous ordinances.<br><br>
     <sup><b>63</b></sup> I am a companion to all who fear You / And to those who keep Your precepts.<br><br>
     <sup><b>64</b></sup> Your lovingkindness, O Jehovah, fills the earth; / Teach me Your statutes.<br><br>
     <sup><b>65</b></sup> You have dealt well with Your servant, / O Jehovah, according to Your word.<br><br>
     <sup><b>66</b></sup> Teach me proper discernment and knowledge, / For I believe in Your commandments.<br><br>
     <sup><b>67</b></sup> Before I was afflicted, I went astray; / But now I keep Your word.<br><br>
     <sup><b>68</b></sup> You are good and One who does good; / Teach me Your statutes.<br><br>
     <sup><b>69</b></sup> The proud have plastered lies against me; / With <i>my</i> whole heart I will keep Your precepts.<br><br>
     <sup><b>70</b></sup> Their heart is heavy as with fat; / <i>But</i> I delight in Your law.<br><br>
     <sup><b>71</b></sup> It is good for me that I have been afflicted, / That I might learn Your statutes.<br><br>
     <sup><b>72</b></sup> The law of Your mouth is better to me / Than thousands of <i>pieces of</i> gold and silver.<br><br>
     <sup><b>73</b></sup> Your hands have made me and fashioned me; / Give me understanding that I may learn Your commandments.<br><br>
     <sup><b>74</b></sup> Those who fear You will see me and rejoice, / For I have hoped in Your word.<br><br>
     <sup><b>75</b></sup> I know, O Jehovah, that Your judgments are righteous / And that in faithfulness You afflicted me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>76</b></sup> Let Your lovingkindness, I beseech You, be my comfort, / According to Your word to Your servant.<br><br>
     <sup><b>77</b></sup> Let Your compassions come to me, and I will live; / For Your law is my delight.<br><br>
     <sup><b>78</b></sup> Let the proud be put to shame, for they have subverted my cause with a lie; / <i>But</i> I will muse upon Your precepts.<br><br>
     <sup><b>79</b></sup> Let those who fear You turn to me, / And they will know Your testimonies.<br><br>
     <sup><b>80</b></sup> May my heart be perfect in Your statutes, / That I may not be put to shame.<br><br>
     <sup><b>81</b></sup> My soul faints <i>while longing</i> for Your salvation; / I hope in Your word.<br><br>
     <sup><b>82</b></sup> My eyes faint <i>while longing</i> for Your word, / As I say, When will You comfort me?<br><br>
     <sup><b>83</b></sup> For I have become like a wineskin in the smoke; / <i>But</i> I do not forget Your statutes.<br><br>
     <sup><b>84</b></sup> How many are the days of Your servant? / When will You execute justice upon my persecutors?<br><br>
     <sup><b>85</b></sup> The proud have dug pits for me, / Those who are not according to Your law.<br><br>
     <sup><b>86</b></sup> All Your commandments are faithful; / They persecute me falsely; help me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>87</b></sup> They have almost consumed me upon the earth; / But I have not forsaken Your precepts.<br><br>
     <sup><b>88</b></sup> Enliven me according to Your lovingkindness, / And I will keep the testimony of Your mouth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>89</b></sup> Forever, O Jehovah, / Does Your word stand firm in heaven.<br><br>
     <sup><b>90</b></sup> Your faithfulness is from generation to generation; / You established the earth, and it abides.<br><br>
     <sup><b>91</b></sup> They abide to this day according to Your ordinances, / For all things are Your servants.<br><br>
     <sup><b>92</b></sup> Unless Your law had been my delight, / I would have perished in my affliction.<br><br>
     <sup><b>93</b></sup> I will never forget Your precepts, / For by them You have enlivened me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>94</b></sup> I am Yours; save me, / For I have sought Your precepts.<br><br>
     <sup><b>95</b></sup> The wicked have waited for me in order to destroy me, / <i>But</i> I consider Your testimonies.<br><br>
     <sup><b>96</b></sup> I have seen an end to all perfection, / <i>But</i> Your commandment is all-expansive.<br><br>
     <sup><b>97</b></sup> Oh, how I love Your law! / All day long it is my musing.<br><br>
     <sup><b>98</b></sup> Your commandments make me wiser than my enemies, / For they are always with me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>99</b></sup> I have more insight than all my teachers, / For Your testimonies are my musing.<br><br>
     <sup><b>100</b></sup> I understand more than the aged, / For I have kept Your precepts.<br><br>
     <sup><b>101</b></sup> I have withheld my feet from every evil way, / That I might keep Your word.<br><br>
     <sup><b>102</b></sup> I have not turned aside from Your ordinances, / For You have taught me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>103</b></sup> How sweet are Your words to my taste! / <i>Sweeter</i> than honey to my mouth!<br><br>
     <sup><b>104</b></sup> Through Your precepts I gain understanding; / Therefore I hate every false way.<br><br>
     <sup><b>105</b></sup> Your word is a lamp to my feet / And a light to my path.<br><br>
     <sup><b>106</b></sup> I have sworn and will confirm <i>it,</i> / That I will keep Your righteous ordinances.<br><br>
     <sup><b>107</b></sup> I have been greatly afflicted; / O Jehovah, enliven me according to Your word.<br><br>
     <sup><b>108</b></sup> Accept, I pray, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O Jehovah; / And teach me Your ordinances.<br><br>
     <sup><b>109</b></sup> My soul is continually in my hand, / But I do not forget Your law.<br><br>
     <sup><b>110</b></sup> The wicked have laid a trap for me, / But I do not stray from Your precepts.<br><br>
     <sup><b>111</b></sup> Your testimonies are my heritage forever, / For they are the gladness of my heart.<br><br>
     <sup><b>112</b></sup> I have inclined my heart to perform Your statutes / Forever, to the end.<br><br>
     <sup><b>113</b></sup> I hate those who are double-minded, / But I love Your law.<br><br>
     <sup><b>114</b></sup> You are my hiding place and my shield; / In Your word do I hope.<br><br>
     <sup><b>115</b></sup> Depart from me, you evildoers, / That I may keep the commandments of my God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>116</b></sup> Uphold me according to Your word that I may live, / And do not let me be ashamed of my hope.<br><br>
     <sup><b>117</b></sup> Hold me up that I may be safe, / And I will regard Your statutes continually.<br><br>
     <sup><b>118</b></sup> You spurn all those who stray from Your statutes, / For their deceitfulness is vain.<br><br>
     <sup><b>119</b></sup> You do away with all the wicked ones of the earth <i>like</i> dross; / Therefore I love Your testimonies.<br><br>
     <sup><b>120</b></sup> My flesh trembles for fear of You, / And I am afraid of Your judgments.<br><br>
     <sup><b>121</b></sup> I have performed justice and righteousness; / Do not leave me to my oppressors.<br><br>
     <sup><b>122</b></sup> Guarantee Your servant’s well-being; / Do not let the proud oppress me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>123</b></sup> My eyes faint <i>while longing</i> for Your salvation / And for Your righteous word.<br><br>
     <sup><b>124</b></sup> Deal with Your servant according to Your lovingkindness, / And teach me Your statutes.<br><br>
     <sup><b>125</b></sup> I am Your servant; give me understanding, / That I may know Your testimonies.<br><br>
     <sup><b>126</b></sup> It is time for Jehovah to act, / <i>For</i> they have broken Your law.<br><br>
     <sup><b>127</b></sup> Therefore I love Your commandments / More than gold, indeed, more than fine gold;<br><br>
     <sup><b>128</b></sup> Therefore I esteem all <i>Your</i> precepts concerning all things to be right, / <i>And</i> I hate every false way.<br><br>
     <sup><b>129</b></sup> Your testimonies are wonderful; / Therefore my soul keeps them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>130</b></sup> The opening of Your words gives light, / Imparting understanding to the simple.<br><br>
     <sup><b>131</b></sup> I opened my mouth wide and panted, / For I longed for Your commandments.<br><br>
     <sup><b>132</b></sup> Turn to me, and be gracious to me, / As is <i>Your</i> custom with those who love Your name.<br><br>
     <sup><b>133</b></sup> Establish my footsteps in Your word, / And do not let any iniquity have dominion over me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>134</b></sup> Redeem me from man’s oppression, / That I may keep Your precepts.<br><br>
     <sup><b>135</b></sup> Cause Your face to shine on Your servant, / And teach me Your statutes.<br><br>
     <sup><b>136</b></sup> My eyes shed streams of water, / Because men do not keep Your law.<br><br>
     <sup><b>137</b></sup> You are righteous, O Jehovah; / And Your judgments are upright.<br><br>
     <sup><b>138</b></sup> You have commanded Your testimonies in righteousness / And great faithfulness.<br><br>
     <sup><b>139</b></sup> My zeal has consumed me, / For my adversaries have forgotten Your words.<br><br>
     <sup><b>140</b></sup> Your word is very pure, / And Your servant loves it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>141</b></sup> I am small and despised, / <i>But</i> I do not forget Your precepts.<br><br>
     <sup><b>142</b></sup> Your righteousness is an eternal righteousness, / And Your law is truth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>143</b></sup> Distress and anguish have come upon me, / <i>But</i> Your commandments are my delight.<br><br>
     <sup><b>144</b></sup> Your testimonies are righteous forever; / Give me understanding, and I will live.<br><br>
     <sup><b>145</b></sup> I called with <i>my</i> whole heart; answer me, O Jehovah. / I will keep Your statutes.<br><br>
     <sup><b>146</b></sup> I called upon You; save me, / And I will observe Your testimonies.<br><br>
     <sup><b>147</b></sup> I anticipated the dawn and cried out; / I hoped in Your words.<br><br>
     <sup><b>148</b></sup> My eyes anticipated the night watches, / That I might muse upon Your word.<br><br>
     <sup><b>149</b></sup> Hear my voice according to Your lovingkindness; / O Jehovah, according to Your ordinances enliven me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>150</b></sup> Those who persecute me with evil intent draw near; / They are far from Your law.<br><br>
     <sup><b>151</b></sup> You are near, O Jehovah; / And all Your commandments are truth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>152</b></sup> Of old I have known from Your testimonies / That You have founded them forever.<br><br>
     <sup><b>153</b></sup> Look at my affliction, and deliver me; / For I have not forgotten Your law.<br><br>
     <sup><b>154</b></sup> Plead my case, and redeem me; / Enliven me according to Your word.<br><br>
     <sup><b>155</b></sup> Salvation is far from the wicked, / For they do not seek Your statutes.<br><br>
     <sup><b>156</b></sup> Great are Your compassions, O Jehovah; / Enliven me according to Your ordinances.<br><br>
     <sup><b>157</b></sup> Many are my persecutors and my adversaries, / <i>But</i> I have not swerved from Your testimonies.<br><br>
     <sup><b>158</b></sup> I saw the treacherous and loathed <i>them,</i> / Because they did not keep Your word.<br><br>
     <sup><b>159</b></sup> See how I have loved Your precepts; / O Jehovah, enliven me according to Your lovingkindness.<br><br>
     <sup><b>160</b></sup> The sum of Your word is truth, / And all Your righteous ordinances are forever.<br><br>
     <sup><b>161</b></sup> Princes have persecuted me without cause, / But my heart stands in awe of Your words.<br><br>
     <sup><b>162</b></sup> I rejoice at Your word, / Like one who finds great spoil.<br><br>
     <sup><b>163</b></sup> I hate and abhor falsehood, / <i>But</i> I love Your law.<br><br>
     <sup><b>164</b></sup> Seven times a day I praise You / For Your righteous ordinances.<br><br>
     <sup><b>165</b></sup> There is great peace for those who love Your law, / And there is no occasion of stumbling for them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>166</b></sup> I have hoped for Your salvation, O Jehovah; / And I have done Your commandments.<br><br>
     <sup><b>167</b></sup> My soul has kept Your testimonies, / And I love them very much.<br><br>
     <sup><b>168</b></sup> I have kept Your precepts and Your testimonies, / For all my ways are before You.<br><br>
     <sup><b>169</b></sup> Let my cry come before You, O Jehovah; / Give me understanding according to Your word.<br><br>
     <sup><b>170</b></sup> Let my supplication come before You; / Deliver me according to Your word.<br><br>
     <sup><b>171</b></sup> Let my lips pour forth praise, / For You teach me Your statutes.<br><br>
     <sup><b>172</b></sup> Let my tongue sing of Your word, / For all Your commandments are righteousness.<br><br>
     <sup><b>173</b></sup> Let Your hand be ready to help me, / For I have chosen Your precepts.<br><br>
     <sup><b>174</b></sup> I have longed for Your salvation, O Jehovah, / And Your law is my delight.<br><br>
     <sup><b>175</b></sup> Let my soul live, and it will praise You; / And let Your ordinances help me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>176</b></sup> I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek Your servant, / For I have not forgotten Your commandments.<br><br>
