  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then one day, when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, Satan also came among them to present himself before Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And Jehovah said to Satan, Where have you come from? And Satan answered Jehovah and said, From roving the earth and going about in it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And Jehovah said to Satan, Have you considered My servant Job? For there is none like him on the earth, a perfect and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil. And he still holds fast his integrity, though you have moved Me against him to destroy him without cause.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Then Satan answered Jehovah and said, Skin for skin! Indeed all that a man has he will give for the sake of his life.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> But stretch forth Your hand, and touch his bone and his flesh; and he will surely curse You to Your face.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And Jehovah said to Satan, Here he is, in your hand; only spare his life.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And Satan went forth from Jehovah’s presence and struck Job with severe boils from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And he took a potsherd with which to scrape himself, and he sat among the ashes.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> Then his wife said to him, Do you still hold fast your integrity? Curse God and die.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> But he said to her, You speak as one of the foolish women speaks. Should we receive the good from God but not receive the ill? In all this Job did not sin with his lips.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this misfortune that came upon him, each came from his place, Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite; and they together made an appointment to come to console him and comfort him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And when they lifted up their eyes from a distance and did not recognize him, they lifted up their voice and wept; and they all tore their clothes and cast dust over their heads toward heaven.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> And they sat with him on the ground seven days and seven nights; but none spoke a word to him, for they saw that his pain was very great.<br><br>
