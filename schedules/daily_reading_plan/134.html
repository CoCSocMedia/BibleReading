  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And after this David struck the Philistines and subdued them. And David took Gath and her villages out of the hand of the Philistines.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And he struck Moab, and the Moabites became servants to David and brought tribute.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> Then David struck Hadadezer the king of Zobah at Hamath, when he went to establish his power at the river Euphrates.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And David took from him one thousand chariots and seven thousand horsemen and twenty thousand foot soldiers. And David hamstrung all the chariot horses but left <i>enough</i> of them for a hundred chariots.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer the king of Zobah, David struck twenty-two thousand men among the Syrians.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And David put <i>garrisons</i> among the Syrians of Damascus, and the Syrians became servants to David and brought tribute. And Jehovah preserved David wherever he went.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And from Tibhath and Cun, cities of Hadadezer, David took very much bronze, with which Solomon made the bronze sea and the pillars and the vessels of bronze.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> Then when Tou the king of Hamath heard that David had struck down all the army of Hadadezer the king of Zobah,<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> He sent Hadoram his son to King David to greet him and congratulate him for fighting against Hadadezer and striking him down, for Hadadezer had been at war with Tou. And <i>Hadoram brought</i> all kinds of articles of gold and of silver and of bronze.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> King David consecrated these also to Jehovah along with the silver and gold that he had carried from all the nations: from the Edomites and from the Moabites and from the children of Ammon and from the Philistines and from the Amalekites.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah struck down the Edomites in the Valley of Salt, <i>that is,</i> eighteen thousand men.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> And he put garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites became servants to David. And Jehovah preserved David wherever he went.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> So David reigned over all Israel and executed justice and righteousness for all his people.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army, and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And Zadok the son of Ahitub and Abimelech the son of Abiathar were priests, and Shavsha was scribe.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and David’s sons were chief at the king’s side.<br><br>
