  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And when David and his men came to Ziklag on the third day, the Amalekites had made a raid upon the south and upon Ziklag; and they had struck Ziklag and burned it with fire.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And they had taken the women <i>and all</i> who were in it captive, both small and great; they had killed none, but had carried <i>them</i> off, and had gone on their way.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And David and his men came to the city; and there it was, burned with fire. And their wives and their sons and their daughters had been taken captive.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And David and the people who were with him lifted up their voice and wept until they had no strength to weep.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And David’s two wives had been taken captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelite and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And David was very distressed because the people spoke of stoning him, for the soul of all the people was bitter, every man because of his sons and his daughters. But David strengthened himself in Jehovah his God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, Bring the ephod to me. So Abiathar brought the ephod to David.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I pursue after this band? Will I overtake them? And He said to him, Pursue, for you will certainly overtake <i>them,</i> and you will certainly deliver <i>them.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> So David went, he and the six hundred men who were with him; and they came to the brook Besor, where those who were left stayed behind.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And David pursued, he and four hundred men; for two hundred stayed behind, who were too exhausted to cross over the brook Besor.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And they found an Egyptian in the field and brought him to David. And they gave him food, and he ate; and they gave him water to drink.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And they gave him a piece of fig cake and two raisin cakes; and he ate, and his spirit returned to him; for he had eaten no food and had drunk no water for three days and three nights.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> And David said to him, To whom do you belong and where are you from? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, the servant of an Amalekite man; and my master abandoned me because I fell sick three days ago.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> We attacked the south of the Cherethites and what belongs to Judah and the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And David said to him, Can you lead me down to this band? And he said, Swear to me by God that you will neither kill me nor deliver me into the hand of my master, and I will lead you down to this troop.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And he led him down; and there they were, spread over the whole land, eating and drinking and celebrating because of all the great spoil that they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> And David struck them from twilight until the evening of the next day; and not a man of them escaped except for four hundred young men, who rode upon camels and fled.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> And David delivered all that the Amalekites had taken; and David delivered his two wives.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> And nothing was missed by them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil nor anything that they had taken; David brought everything back.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> And David took all the flocks and the herds, <i>which</i> they drove before the other cattle and <i>of which</i> they said, This is David’s spoil.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> Then David came to the two hundred men who had been too exhausted to follow David and who had been left behind at the brook Besor. And they went forth to meet David and to meet the people who were with him; and David came near to the people and greeted them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> And all the wicked and worthless men among the men that had gone with David responded; and they said, Because they did not go with us, we will not give them anything of the spoil that we have delivered, except every man his wife and his children that they may lead <i>them</i> off and go away.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> Then said David, You shall not do so, my brothers, with that which Jehovah has given us, who has kept us and given this band that came against us into our hand.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> And who will listen to you in this matter? For as his share is who goes down to the battle, so shall his share be who stays by the baggage; they shall share alike.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> And from that day forward he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> And David came to Ziklag, and he sent some of the spoil to the elders of Judah, to his companions, saying, Here is a present for you from the spoil of the enemies of Jehovah:<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> For those in Bethel, and for those in Ramoth of the south, and for those in Jattir,<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> And for those in Aroer, and for those in Siphmoth, and for those in Eshtemoa,<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> And for those in Racal, and for those in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and for those in the cities of the Kenites,<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> And for those in Hormah, and for those in Bor-ashan, and for those in Athach,<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> And for those in Hebron, and for all the places where David himself and his men had gone about.<br><br>
