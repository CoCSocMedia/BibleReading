  <h4 id="1samuel-9"><a onclick="open_chapter('top', '9-1samuel.html')">1 Samuel 9</a></h4>
  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Now there was a man from Benjamin whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjaminite, a man of wealth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And he had a son whose name was Saul, a choice and handsome man; and there was not a man among the children of Israel more handsome than he; from his shoulders and up he was taller than all the people.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> Now the donkeys of Kish, Saul’s father, were lost; and Kish said to Saul his son, Take with you one of the servants, and rise up <i>and</i> go to search for the donkeys.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And he passed through the hill country of Ephraim, and he passed through the land of Shalishah; but they did not find <i>them.</i> Then they passed through the land of Shaalim, but they were not <i>there.</i> Then he passed through the land of Benjamin, but they did not find <i>them.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> When they came to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, Come, and let us return; otherwise, my father will stop <i>worrying</i> about the donkeys and will worry about us.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> But he said to him, There is a man of God here in this city, and he is a man held in honor; all that he says happens without fail. Let us now go there; perhaps he will tell us about our journey that we have set out on.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And Saul said to his servant, But if we go, what will we bring the man? For the food is gone from our bags, and there is no present to bring the man of God. What do we have?<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And the servant answered Saul again and said, Here in my hand is a quarter shekel of silver, and I can give <i>it</i> to the man of God; then he will tell us our way.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> (Formerly in Israel a man spoke this way when he went to inquire of God, Come, and let us go to the seer; for today’s prophet was formerly called a seer.)<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> Then Saul said to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went to the city where the man of God was.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> As they went up the ascent into the city, they found some girls coming out to draw water; and they said to them, Is the seer here?<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And they answered them and said, He is; there he is ahead of you. Hurry now; for he has <i>just</i> come to the city today, because the people have a sacrifice at the high place today.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> Right when you enter the city, you will find him, before he goes up to the high place to eat. For the people will not eat until he comes, because he is the one who blesses the sacrifice. Right after that, those who have been invited will eat. Go up now then, for you will find him right away.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> So they went up into the city. As they came into the midst of the city, there came Samuel out toward them, going up to the high place.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> Now Jehovah had revealed <i>this</i> to Samuel a day before Saul came, saying,<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> At about this time tomorrow I will send to you a man from the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him ruler over My people Israel; and he will save My people from the hand of the Philistines, for I have looked upon My people because their cry has come to Me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> And when Samuel saw Saul, Jehovah declared to him, Here is the man of whom I spoke to you. This man shall rule over My people.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> And Saul approached Samuel in the gate and said, Tell me, please, where is the seer’s house?<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> And Samuel answered Saul and said, I am the seer. Go up before me to the high place, for you shall eat with me today; and in the morning I will send you away, and I will tell you all that is in your heart.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> And as for your donkeys that have now been lost three days, do not <i>even</i> consider them; for they have been found. And for whom is all the desire of Israel? Is it not for you and for all your father’s house?<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And Saul answered and said, Am I not a Benjaminite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? And <i>is not</i> my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then do you speak to me in this way?<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them to the hall, and put them in the chief place among those who had been invited; and there were about thirty men.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> And Samuel said to the cook, Bring the portion that I gave, concerning which I said to you, Set it by you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> And the cook took up the thigh and what was attached to it, and set <i>it</i> before Saul. And <i>Samuel</i> said, Here is what has been reserved. Set <i>it</i> before you <i>and</i> eat, because it has been kept for you for the appointed time, when I said I was inviting the people. So Saul ate with Samuel that day.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> And when they came down from the high place to the city, he spoke with Saul upon the roof.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> And they rose early; and around the break of dawn Samuel called to Saul on the roof, saying, Rise up, and I will send you away. So Saul rose up, and they both went outside, he and Samuel.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> As they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Tell the servant to go on ahead of us — and <i>the servant</i> went on — but you stand here now, and I will let you hear the word of God.<br><br>
