  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Now Moses was shepherding the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian; and he led the flock to the back of the wilderness and came to the mountain of God, to Horeb.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And the Angel of Jehovah appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a thornbush. And when he looked, there was the thornbush, burning with fire; but the thornbush was not consumed.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And Moses said, I must turn aside now and see this great sight, why the thornbush does not burn up.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And when Jehovah saw that he had turned aside to look, God called to him out of the midst of the thornbush and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here I am.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And He said, Do not come near here. Remove your sandals from your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And He said, I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And Jehovah said, I have surely seen the affliction of My people who are in Egypt and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters, for I know their sorrows.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land to a good and spacious land, to a land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> And now the cry of the children of Israel has come to Me, and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> So come now, and I will send you to Pharaoh, that you may bring My people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> But Moses said to God, Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and that I should bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And He said, Surely I will be with you, and this shall be the sign for you that I have sent you: When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you will serve God upon this mountain.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> Then Moses said to God, If I come to the children of Israel and say to them, The God of your fathers has sent me to you, and they say to me, What is His name? what shall I say to them?<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> And God said to Moses, I AM WHO I AM. And He said, Thus you shall say to the children of Israel, I AM has sent me to you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And God also said to Moses, Thus you shall say to the children of Israel, Jehovah, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you. This is My name forever, and this is My memorial from generation to generation.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say to them, Jehovah, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has appeared to me, saying, I have surely visited you and <i>seen</i> what is being done to you in Egypt.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> And I say, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites, to a land flowing with milk and honey.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> And they will listen to your voice. And you shall come, you and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and you shall say to him, Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us; and now let us go a three days’ journey into the wilderness that we may sacrifice to Jehovah our God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless <i>compelled</i> by a mighty hand.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> So I will stretch out My hand and strike Egypt with all My wonders which I will perform in the midst of it, and after that he will let you go.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that when you go, you will not go empty-handed.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> But every woman will ask of her neighbor and of any woman living in her house for articles of silver and articles of gold and clothing, and you will put <i>them</i> on your sons and on your daughters, and thus plunder the Egyptians.<br><br>

  <h4 id="exodus-4"><a onclick="open_chapter('top', '2-exodus.html')">Exodus 4</a></h4>
  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then Moses answered and said, What if they do not believe me or listen to my voice, but say, Jehovah has not appeared to you?<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And Jehovah said to him, What is this in your hand? And he said, A staff.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And He said, Throw it on the ground. And he threw it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses recoiled from it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch out your hand, and take <i>it</i> by its tail — so he stretched out his hand and seized it, and it became a staff in his hand —<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> That they may believe that Jehovah, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And Jehovah further said to him, Now put your hand into your bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom, and when he took it out, there his hand was, leprous, <i>as white</i> as snow.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And He said, Put your hand into your bosom again — so he put his hand into his bosom again, and when he took it out of his bosom, there it was, restored like <i>the rest of</i> his flesh —<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And if they do not believe you or heed the first sign, then they may believe the next sign.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> And if they will not believe even these two signs or listen to your voice, then you shall take some of the water of the River and pour <i>it</i> on the dry ground, and the water that you take out of the River will become blood upon the dry ground.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And Moses said to Jehovah, Please, Lord, I am not a man of words, neither in the past, nor since You have spoken to Your servant, for I am slow of speech and slow of tongue.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And Jehovah said to him, Who gave man a mouth? Or who makes <i>him</i> dumb or deaf or seeing or blind? Is it not I, Jehovah?<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> Now go therefore, and I will be with your mouth and will teach you what you shall speak.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> And he said, Please, Lord, send <i>word</i> by sending <i>someone else.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Moses, and He said, Is there not Aaron your brother the Levite? I know that he can certainly speak. And even now he is coming out to meet you; and when he sees you, he will be glad in his heart.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And you shall speak to him and put the words in his mouth, and I will be with your mouth and with his mouth, and will teach you what you shall do.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And he shall speak for you to the people, and he shall be as a mouth for you, and you shall be as God to him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> And you shall take in your hand this staff, with which you shall perform the signs.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> And Moses went back to Jethro his father-in-law. And he said to him, Please let me go and return to my brothers who are in Egypt and see whether they are still alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> And Jehovah said to Moses in Midian, Go, return to Egypt; for all the men who were seeking your life have died.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> So Moses took his wife and his sons, and mounted them upon a donkey, and returned to the land of Egypt. And Moses took the staff of God in his hand.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And Jehovah said to Moses, When you go to return to Egypt, see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have put in your power; but I will harden his heart, and he will not let the people go.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> Then you shall say to Pharaoh, Thus says Jehovah, Israel is My son, My firstborn.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> And I said to you, Let My son go that he may serve Me; but you have refused to let him go. I will now slay your son, your firstborn.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> And at the lodging place on the way, Jehovah came upon him and sought to put him to death.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> Then Zipporah took a flint and cut off her son’s foreskin and cast <i>it</i> at <i>Moses’</i> feet, and she said, You are indeed a bridegroom of blood to me!<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> So He let him alone. It was then that she said, A bridegroom of blood, because of the circumcision.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> And Jehovah said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went and came upon him at the mountain of God, and he kissed him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> And Moses told Aaron all the words of Jehovah with which He had sent him and all the signs with which He had charged him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> And Aaron spoke all the words which Jehovah had spoken to Moses, and he performed the signs in the sight of the people.<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> And the people believed; and when they heard that Jehovah had visited the children of Israel and that He had seen their affliction, they bowed and worshipped.<br><br>
