  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> In the third month after the children of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt, on that very day they came into the wilderness of Sinai.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And when they had journeyed from Rephidim and had come to the wilderness of Sinai, they encamped in the wilderness; and there Israel encamped in front of the mountain.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And Moses went up to God, and Jehovah called to him out of the mountain, saying, Thus you shall say to the house of Jacob and tell the children of Israel:<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> You have seen what I did to the Egyptians and <i>how</i> I bore you on eagles’ wings and brought you to Myself.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> Now therefore if you will indeed obey My voice and keep My covenant, then you shall be My personal treasure from among all peoples, for all the earth is Mine.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. These are the words that you shall speak to the children of Israel.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> So Moses came and called for the elders of the people and set before them all these words which Jehovah had commanded him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And all the people answered together and said, All that Jehovah has spoken we will do. And Moses brought back the words of the people to Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> And Jehovah said to Moses, I am coming to you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you and may also believe you forever. Then Moses told the words of the people to Jehovah,<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And Jehovah said to Moses, Go to the people, and sanctify them today and tomorrow; and have them wash their garments,<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And be ready for the third day; for on the third day Jehovah will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And you shall set limits for the people all around, saying, Be careful that you do not go up on the mountain or touch the border of it. Whoever touches the mountain shall surely be put to death.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> No hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned or shot through; whether beast or man, he shall not live. When the trumpet sounds a long blast, they may come up on the mountain.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> And Moses went down from the mountain to the people and sanctified the people, and they washed their garments.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And he said to the people, Be ready for the third day. Do not go near a woman.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And on the third day, when it was morning, there was thunder and lightning, and a thick cloud upon the mountain, and a very loud trumpet sound; and all the people who were in the camp trembled.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> And Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God, and they stood at the base of the mountain.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> Now the whole of Mount Sinai smoked because Jehovah descended upon it in fire, and its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace; and the whole mountain shook greatly.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> And as the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him in thunder.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> And Jehovah came down upon Mount Sinai at the top of the mountain, and Jehovah called Moses to the top of the mountain; and Moses went up.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> Then Jehovah said to Moses, Go down; charge the people not to break through to Jehovah to look, lest many of them perish.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> And let the priests who come near to Jehovah also sanctify themselves, so that Jehovah does not break forth upon them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> And Moses said to Jehovah, The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai, for You charged us, saying, Set limits around the mountain, and sanctify it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> And Jehovah said to him, Go, get down; then you shall come up <i>again,</i> you and Aaron with you; but do not let the priests and the people force a way through to come up to Jehovah, so that He does not break forth upon them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> So Moses went down to the people and told them.<br><br>

  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And God spoke all these words, saying,<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the slave house;<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> You shall have no other gods before Me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> You shall not make for yourself an idol, nor the form of anything that is in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the water beneath the earth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> You shall not bow down to them, and you shall not serve them; for I, Jehovah your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, to the third and fourth <i>generations</i> of those who hate Me,<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> Yet showing lovingkindness to thousands <i>of generations</i> of those who love Me and keep My commandments.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> You shall not take the name of Jehovah your God in vain, for Jehovah will not hold guiltless him who takes His name in vain.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> Remember the Sabbath day so as to sanctify it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> Six days you shall labor and do all your work,<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> But the seventh day is a Sabbath to Jehovah your God; you shall not do any work, you nor your son nor your daughter, your male servant nor your female servant, nor your cattle nor the sojourner with you, who is within your gates.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> For in six days Jehovah made heaven and earth, the sea and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day; therefore Jehovah blessed the Sabbath day and sanctified it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be extended upon the land which Jehovah your God is giving you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> You shall not kill.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> You shall not commit adultery.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> You shall not steal.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> You shall not testify with false testimony against your neighbor.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> You shall not covet your neighbor’s house; you shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, nor his male servant, nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor anything that belongs to your neighbor.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> And all the people witnessed the thunder and the flashes of lightning and the sound of the trumpet and the mountain smoking; and when the people witnessed <i>it,</i> they trembled and stood at a distance.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> And they said to Moses, You speak with us, and we will listen; but do not let God speak with us, so we do not die.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> And Moses said to the people, Do not be afraid; for God has come in order to test you and in order that the fear of Him may be before you, so that you do not sin.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And the people stood at a distance, and Moses drew near to the deep darkness where God was.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> And Jehovah said to Moses, Thus shall you say to the children of Israel, You yourselves have seen that I have spoken to you from heaven.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> You shall not make <i>other gods</i> besides Me; gods of silver or gods of gold, you shall not make for yourselves.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> An altar of earth you shall make for Me, and you shall sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings, your sheep and your oxen; in every place where I cause My name to be remembered, I will come to you and bless you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> And if you make Me an altar of stone, you shall not build it of hewn stones; for if you lift up your tool upon them, you have polluted them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> Neither shall you go up by steps to My altar, so that your nakedness may not be uncovered on it.<br><br>
