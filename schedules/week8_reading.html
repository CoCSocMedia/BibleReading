  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then Moses and the children of Israel sang this song to Jehovah and spoke, saying,I will sing to Jehovah, for He has triumphed gloriously; / The horse and its rider He has cast into the sea.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Jah is my strength and song, / And He has become my salvation; / This is my God, and I will praise Him; / My father’s God, and I will exalt Him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> Jehovah is a man of war; / Jehovah is His name.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Pharaoh’s chariots and his army He has thrown into the sea; / And his choice officers have drowned in the Red Sea.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> The deep waters cover them; / They went down into the depths like a stone.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> Your right hand, O Jehovah, is glorious in power; / Your right hand, O Jehovah, dashed the enemy in pieces.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And in the greatness of Your excellence / You overthrew those who rose up against You. / You sent forth Your burning wrath; / It consumed them like stubble.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And with the blast of Your nostrils the waters were heaped up; / The flowing currents stood up like a heap; / The deep waters congealed in the heart of the sea.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; / My desire will be satisfied upon them; / I will draw my sword; my hand will destroy them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> You blew with Your wind; the sea covered them; / They sank like lead in the mighty waters.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> Who is like You, O Jehovah, among the gods? / Who is like You, splendid in holiness, / Awesome in praises, doing wonders?<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> You stretched out Your right hand; / The earth swallowed them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> In Your lovingkindness You have led the people whom You have redeemed; / You have guided them in Your strength to Your holy habitation.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> The peoples heard; they trembled; / Pangs have seized the inhabitants of Philistia.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> Then the chiefs of Edom are dismayed; / The mighty men of Moab — trembling has seized them; / All the inhabitants of Canaan have melted away.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> Terror and dread have fallen upon them; / By the greatness of Your arm they have become as still as stone, / Until Your people passed over, O Jehovah, / Until the people whom You purchased passed over.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> You will bring them in and plant them in the mountain of Your inheritance, / The place, O Jehovah, which You have made for Your dwelling, / The sanctuary, O Lord, which Your hands have established.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> Jehovah shall reign forever and ever.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> For the horses of Pharaoh with his chariots and with his horsemen went into the sea, and Jehovah brought back the waters of the sea upon them while the children of Israel walked on dry land through the midst of the sea.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a tambourine in her hand; and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dancing.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And Miriam responded to them,Sing to Jehovah, for He has triumphed gloriously; / The horse and its rider He has cast into the sea.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> Then Moses moved Israel onward from the Red Sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur. And they went three days in the wilderness and found no water.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter; therefore its name was called Marah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> And he cried out to Jehovah, and Jehovah showed him a tree; and he cast it into the waters, and the waters became sweet. There He made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there He tested them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> And He said, If you will listen carefully to the voice of Jehovah your God and do what is right in His eyes and give ear to His commandments and keep all His statutes, I will put none of the diseases on you which I have put on the Egyptians; for I am Jehovah who heals you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> And they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees; and they encamped there by the waters.<br><br>

  <h4 id="exodus-16"><a onclick="open_chapter('top', '2-exodus.html')">Exodus 16</a></h4>
  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And they journeyed from Elim, and all the assembly of the children of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departure out of the land of Egypt.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And the whole assembly of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron in the wilderness.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And the children of Israel said to them, If only we had died by the hand of Jehovah in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the fleshpots, when we ate bread to the full; for you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this whole congregation with hunger.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Then Jehovah said to Moses, I will now rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a day’s portion every day, that I may test them, whether or not they will walk in My law.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And on the sixth day when they prepare what they bring in, it will be twice as much as they gather daily.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> So Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel, In the evening you will know that Jehovah has brought you out from the land of Egypt;<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And in the morning you will see the glory of Jehovah, for He hears your murmurings against Jehovah. And what are we, that you murmur against us?<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And Moses said, <i>This you will see</i> when Jehovah gives you flesh to eat in the evening and bread to the full in the morning, for Jehovah hears your murmurings which you murmur against Him. And what are we? Your murmurings are not against us but against Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> And Moses said to Aaron, Say to all the assembly of the children of Israel, Come near before Jehovah, for He has heard your murmurings.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And as Aaron spoke to the whole assembly of the children of Israel, they looked toward the wilderness, and there the glory of Jehovah appeared in the cloud.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel. Speak to them, saying, At twilight you will eat flesh, and in the morning you will be filled with bread; and you shall know that I am Jehovah your God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> And at evening quails came up and covered the camp, and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> And when the layer of dew lifted, there upon the surface of the wilderness were fine round flakes, fine as the frost on the earth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And when the children of Israel saw <i>it,</i> they said to one another, What is it? For they did not know what it was. And Moses said to them, It is the bread which Jehovah has given you to eat.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> This is what Jehovah has commanded, Gather of it, each one according to his eating; you shall take an omer a head, according to the number of your persons, each one for those who are in his tent.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> And the children of Israel did so; and <i>some</i> gathered much, and <i>some</i> little.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> And when they measured it with an omer, he who gathered much had no excess, and he who gathered little had no lack; each of them gathered according to his eating.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> And Moses said to them, Let no man leave any of it until the morning.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> But they did not listen to Moses, and some men left part of it until the morning; and it bred worms and stank. And Moses was indignant with them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And they gathered it morning by morning, each one according to his eating; and when the sun became hot, it melted.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> And on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one; and all the leaders of the assembly came and told Moses.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> And he said to them, This is what Jehovah has spoken, Tomorrow is a Sabbath of complete rest, a holy Sabbath to Jehovah. Bake what you will bake, and boil what you will boil, and all that is left over put aside for yourselves to be kept until the morning.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> And they put it aside until the morning, as Moses commanded; and it did not stink, nor was there any worm in it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> And Moses said, Eat it today, for today is a Sabbath to Jehovah; today you will not find it in the field.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day is the Sabbath; on it there will be none.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> And on the seventh day some of the people went out to gather, and they found none.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> And Jehovah said to Moses, How long do you refuse to keep My commandments and My laws?<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> See, Jehovah has given you the Sabbath, therefore He gives you bread for two days on the sixth day. Let each of you stay in his place; let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> So the people rested on the seventh day.<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> And the house of Israel called its name manna, and it was like coriander seed, white; and its taste was like wafers <i>made</i> with honey.<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> And Moses said, This is what Jehovah has commanded, Let an omerful of it be kept throughout your generations, that they may see the bread which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out from the land of Egypt.<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> And Moses said to Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omerful of manna in it, and place it before Jehovah, to be kept throughout your generations.<br><br>
     <sup><b>34</b></sup> As Jehovah commanded Moses, so Aaron placed it before the Testimony to be kept.<br><br>
     <sup><b>35</b></sup> And the children of Israel ate the manna forty years, until they came to inhabitable land; they ate the manna until they came to the border of the land of Canaan.<br><br>
     <sup><b>36</b></sup> Now an omer is a tenth of an ephah.<br><br>
