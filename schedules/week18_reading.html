  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And Moses gathered all the assembly of the children of Israel and said to them, These are the words which Jehovah has commanded you to do.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day you shall have a Sabbath of complete rest, holy to Jehovah; whoever does any work on it shall be put to death.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> You shall kindle no fire in any of your dwellings on the Sabbath day.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And Moses spoke to all the assembly of the children of Israel, saying, This is what Jehovah has commanded, saying,<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> Take from among yourselves a heave offering to Jehovah; whoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it, the heave offering of Jehovah: gold and silver and bronze,<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And blue and purple and scarlet <i>strands,</i> and fine linen, and goats’ <i>hair,</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And rams’ skins dyed red, and porpoise skins, and acacia wood,<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And oil for the light, and spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense,<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> And onyx stones and stones to be set for the ephod and for the breastplate.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And let every man who is wise in heart among you come and make all that Jehovah has commanded:<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> The tabernacle, its tent, and its covering; its clasps and its boards; its bars, its pillars, and its sockets;<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> The Ark and its poles, the expiation cover, and the veil of the screen;<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> The table and its poles and all its utensils, and the bread of the Presence;<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> And the lampstand for the light and its utensils and its lamps, and the oil for the light;<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And the altar of incense and its poles; and the anointing oil and the fragrant incense; and the screen for the entrance, at the entrance of the tabernacle;<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> The altar of burnt offering, with its grating of bronze, its poles, and all its utensils; the laver and its base;<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> The hangings of the court, its pillars, and its sockets, and the screen for the gate of the court;<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> The pegs of the tabernacle and the pegs of the court, and their cords;<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> The finely worked garments for ministering in the sanctuary, the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments of his sons <i>for them</i> to serve as priests.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> And all the assembly of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And they came, everyone whose heart lifted him up and everyone whose spirit made him willing, <i>and</i> brought the heave offering of Jehovah for the work of the Tent of Meeting and for all its service and for the holy garments.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> And they came, men together with women, as many as were of a willing heart, <i>and</i> brought nose rings and earrings and signet rings and pendants, all <i>kinds of</i> articles of gold; even every man who waved a wave offering of gold to Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> And every man with whom was found blue and purple and scarlet <i>strands</i> and fine linen and goats’ <i>hair</i> and rams’ skins dyed red and porpoise skins brought <i>them.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> Everyone who offered a heave offering of silver and bronze brought the heave offering of Jehovah, and every man with whom was found acacia wood for any work of the service brought <i>it.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> And all the women who were wise in heart spun with their hands and brought what they had spun, the blue and the purple <i>and</i> the scarlet <i>strands</i> and the fine linen.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> And all the women whose heart lifted them up in wisdom spun the goats’ <i>hair.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> And the leaders brought the onyx stones and the stones for setting for the ephod and for the breastplate,<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> And the spices and the oil for the light and for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> The children of Israel brought a freewill offering to Jehovah, every man and woman whose heart made them willing to bring for all the work, which Jehovah had commanded through Moses to be done.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> And Moses said to the children of Israel, See, Jehovah has called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> And He has filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom, with understanding, and with knowledge, and with all <i>kinds of</i> workmanship;<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> Even to fashion skillful designs, to work in gold and in silver and in bronze,<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> And in the cutting of stones for setting and in the carving of wood, to work in all <i>kinds of</i> skillful workmanship.<br><br>
     <sup><b>34</b></sup> And He has put in his heart to teach, both he and Oholiab the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.<br><br>
     <sup><b>35</b></sup> He has filled them with wisdom of heart, to work all <i>kinds of</i> workmanship, of an engraver and of a skillful workman and of an embroiderer in blue and in purple <i>and</i> in scarlet <i>strands</i> and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of those who do all <i>kinds of</i> workmanship and of those who fashion skillful designs.<br><br>

  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And Bezalel and Oholiab and every man who is wise in heart, in whom Jehovah has put wisdom and understanding to know how to do all the work for the service of the sanctuary, shall work according to all that Jehovah has commanded.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab and every man who was wise in heart, in whose heart Jehovah had put wisdom, even everyone whose heart lifted him up to come to the work to do it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And they received from Moses every heave offering which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to carry it out. And they still kept bringing to him freewill offerings every morning.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And all the wise men who did all the work of the sanctuary came, every man from his work which he was doing,<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And spoke to Moses, saying, The people are bringing much more than enough for the service of the work which Jehovah commanded <i>us</i> to do.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And Moses gave commandment; and a proclamation was passed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman produce any more material for the heave offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> For the material they had was sufficient and more than enough for all the work, to do it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And all the wise in heart among those who did the work made the tabernacle with ten curtains, of fine twined linen and blue and purple and scarlet <i>strands,</i> with cherubim, the work of a skillful workman. Bezalel made them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> The length of each curtain was twenty-eight cubits, and the width of each curtain, four cubits; all the curtains had the same measurement.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And he joined five curtains to one another, and <i>the other</i> five curtains he joined to one another.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And he made loops of blue <i>strands</i> upon the edge of the one curtain at the end in the set; likewise he made <i>them</i> in the edge of the outermost curtain in the second set.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> He made fifty loops on the one curtain, and he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was in the second set; the loops were opposite one another.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> And he made fifty clasps of gold and joined the curtains to one another with the clasps; so the tabernacle became one.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> And he made curtains of goats’ <i>hair</i> for a tent over the tabernacle; eleven curtains he made in all.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> The length of each curtain was thirty cubits, and the width of each curtain, four cubits; the eleven curtains had the same measurement.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And he joined five of the curtains by themselves, and six of the curtains by themselves.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> And he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was outermost in the set, and fifty loops he made upon the edge of the curtain which was <i>outermost in</i> the second set.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> And he made fifty clasps of bronze to join the tent together, that it might become one.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> And he made a covering for the tent, of rams’ skins dyed red, and a covering of porpoise skins above <i>it.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> And he made the boards for the tabernacle of acacia wood, standing up.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> Ten cubits was the length of a board, and one and a half cubits, the width of each board.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> Each board had two tenons joined to one another; thus he did for all the boards of the tabernacle.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> And he made the boards for the tabernacle, twenty boards for the south side southward.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> And he made forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards, two sockets under one board for its two tenons and two sockets under the next board for its two tenons.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> And for the second side of the tabernacle, on the north side, he made twenty boards<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> And their forty sockets of silver, two sockets under one board and two sockets under the next board.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> And for the rear of the tabernacle westward he made six boards.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> And two boards he made for the corners of the tabernacle in the rear.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> And they were double below, and at its top they were completely joined to a single ring; thus he did to both of them for the two corners.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> And there were eight boards with their sockets of silver, sixteen sockets, two sockets under every board.<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> And he made bars of acacia wood, five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle at the rear westward.<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> And he made the middle bar to pass through in the center of the boards from end to end.<br><br>
     <sup><b>34</b></sup> And he overlaid the boards with gold and made their rings of gold as holders for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.<br><br>
     <sup><b>35</b></sup> And he made the veil of blue and purple and scarlet <i>strands</i> and fine twined linen; he made it with cherubim, the work of a skillful workman.<br><br>
     <sup><b>36</b></sup> And he made for it four pillars of acacia and overlaid them with gold; their hooks were of gold. And he cast for them four sockets of silver.<br><br>
     <sup><b>37</b></sup> And he made a screen for the entrance of the tent, of blue and purple and scarlet <i>strands</i> and fine twined linen, the work of an embroiderer,<br><br>
     <sup><b>38</b></sup> And its five pillars with their hooks. And he overlaid their capitals and their connecting rods with gold, and their five sockets were of bronze.<br><br>
