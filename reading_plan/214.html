  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> See, I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And I have filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom and with understanding and with knowledge and with all <i>kinds of</i> workmanship,<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> To fashion skillful designs, to work in gold and in silver and in bronze,<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And in the cutting of stones for setting and in the carving of wood, to work in all <i>kinds of</i> workmanship.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And now, I Myself have appointed with him Oholiab the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the heart of all who are wise in heart I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded you:<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> The Tent of Meeting, and the Ark of the Testimony and the expiation cover that is on it, and all the utensils of the tent,<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And the table and its utensils, and the pure lampstand with all its utensils, and the altar of incense,<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> And the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the laver and its base,<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And the finely worked garments, both the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments of his sons <i>for them</i> to serve as priests,<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And the anointing oil, and the incense of fragrant spices for the sanctuary. According to all that I have commanded you, they shall do.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> Speak also to the children of Israel, saying, You shall surely keep My Sabbaths; for it is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations, that you may know that I am Jehovah who sanctifies you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> Therefore you shall keep the Sabbath, for it is holy to you. Everyone who profanes it shall surely be put to death; for whoever does any work on it, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> Six days work shall be done, but on the seventh day there is a Sabbath of complete rest, holy to Jehovah; whoever does any work on the Sabbath day shall surely be put to death.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> Therefore the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations as a perpetual covenant.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> It is a sign between Me and the children of Israel forever; for in six days Jehovah made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day He rested and was refreshed.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> And when He had finished speaking with him upon Mount Sinai, He gave to Moses the two tablets of the Testimony, tablets of stone, written with the finger of God.<br><br>
