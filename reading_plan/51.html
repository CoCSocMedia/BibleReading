  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Be therefore imitators of God, as beloved children;<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And walk in love, even as Christ also loved us and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savor.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> But fornication and all uncleanness or greediness, let it not even be named among you, as is fitting for saints,<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And obscenity and foolish talking or sly, filthy jesting, which are not becoming, but rather the giving of thanks.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> For this you realize, knowing that every fornicator or unclean person or greedy person (who is an idolater) has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> Let no one deceive you with vain words, for because of these things the wrath of God is coming upon the sons of disobedience.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Therefore do not be partakers with them;<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> For you were once darkness but are now light in the Lord; walk as children of light<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> (For the fruit of the light consists in all goodness and righteousness and truth),<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> Proving what is well pleasing to the Lord.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And do not participate in the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather even reprove them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> For the things which are done by them in secret it is shameful even to speak of.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> But all things which are reproved are made manifest by the light; for everything that makes manifest is light.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> Therefore He says, Awake, sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> Look therefore carefully how you walk, not as unwise, but as wise,<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> And do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissoluteness, but be filled in spirit,<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> Speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord,<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> Giving thanks at all times for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to our God and Father,<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> Being subject to one another in the fear of Christ:<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> Wives, be subject to your own husbands as to the Lord;<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> For a husband is head of the wife as also Christ is Head of the church, He Himself being the Savior of the Body.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> But as the church is subject to Christ, so also let the wives be subject to their husbands in everything.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> That He might sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing of the water in the word,<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> That He might present the church to Himself glorious, not having spot or wrinkle or any such things, but that she would be holy and without blemish.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> In the same way the husbands also ought to love their own wives as their own bodies; he who loves his own wife loves himself.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as Christ also the church,<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> Because we are members of His Body.<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh.<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> This mystery is great, but I speak with regard to Christ and the church.<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> Nevertheless you also, each one of you, in the same way love your own wife as yourself; and the wife should fear her husband. <br><br>
