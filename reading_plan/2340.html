  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> The burden of the word of Jehovah against the land of Hadrach, / And Damascus will be its resting place / (For Jehovah has an eye on man, / Especially on the tribes of Israel),<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And Hamath also, <i>which</i> borders on it; / Tyre and Sidon, because they are very wise.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> For Tyre built herself a stronghold / And heaped up silver like dust / And gold like the mire of the streets.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> The Lord is about to take possession of her, / And He will strike her might in the sea, / And she will be consumed with fire.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> Ashkelon will see <i>it</i> and be afraid; / Gaza also, and it will writhe much in anguish; / And Ekron, for her expectation will have been confounded. / And the king will perish from Gaza, / And Ashkelon will not be inhabited.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And a mixed race will dwell in Ashdod, / And I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And I will remove his blood from his mouth / And his detestable things from between his teeth; / And he also will remain unto our God; / And he will be like a leader in Judah, / And Ekron will be like a Jebusite.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And I will encamp around My house because of an army, / Because of him who passes by and returns; / And no oppressor will pass over them anymore; / For now I see with My eyes.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> Exult greatly, O daughter of Zion; / Shout, O daughter of Jerusalem! / Now your King comes to you. / He is righteous and bears salvation, / Lowly and riding upon a donkey, / Even upon a colt, the foal of a donkey,<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim / And the horse from Jerusalem, / And the battle bow will be cut off; / And He will speak peace unto the nations, / And His dominion will be from sea to sea / And from the River unto the ends of the earth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> As for you also, because of the blood of your covenant, / I have released your captives from the pit, where there is no water.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> Turn to the stronghold, O prisoners with hope. / This very day I am declaring that I will restore double to you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> For I will bend Judah for Myself, / And I will fill a bow with Ephraim; / And I will stir up your sons, O Zion, / Against your sons, O Javan; / And I will make you like a warrior’s sword.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> And Jehovah will appear above them, / And His arrow will go forth like lightning; / And the Lord Jehovah will blow the trumpet, / And He will go in the whirlwinds of the south.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> Jehovah of hosts will defend them; / And they will devour and trample the sling stones. / And they will drink; they will be noisy as if with wine; / And they will be filled like a <i>sacrificial</i> basin, / Like the corners of the altar.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And Jehovah their God will save them in that day as the flock of His people, / For <i>they will be like</i> the stones of a crown, sparkling in His land.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> For how great is their goodness, and how great their beauty! / Grain will make the young men flourish, / And new wine, the virgins.<br><br>
