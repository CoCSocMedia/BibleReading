  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Moreover you shall say to the children of Israel, Anyone of the children of Israel or of the sojourners who sojourn in Israel who gives any of his offspring to Molech shall surely be put to death; the people of the land shall stone him with stones.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> I will also set My face against that man and will cut him off from among his people because he has given one of his offspring to Molech, so as to defile My sanctuary and profane My holy name.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And if the people of the land ever hide their eyes from that man when he gives some of his offspring to Molech, and do not put him to death,<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> Then I will set My face against that man and against his family, and I will cut off from among their people him and all who prostitute themselves after him, to prostitute themselves after Molech.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And the person who turns to mediums and to spiritists to prostitute himself after them, I will even set My face against that person and will cut him off from among his people.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be holy; for I am Jehovah your God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And you shall keep My statutes and do them; I am Jehovah who sanctifies you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> If there is anyone who curses his father or his mother, he shall surely be put to death. He has cursed his father or his mother; his blood is upon him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> If there is a man who commits adultery with another man’s wife, even one who commits adultery with his neighbor’s wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> If there is a man who lies with his father’s wife, he has uncovered his father’s nakedness. Both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> If there is a man who lies with his daughter-in-law, both of them shall surely be put to death. They have brought about confusion; their blood shall be upon them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> If there is a man who lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination. They shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> If there is a man who takes a wife and her mother, it is wickedness. They shall be burned with fire, both he and they, that there be no wickedness among you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> If there is a man who lies with a beast, he shall surely be put to death; and you shall slaughter the beast.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> If there is a woman who approaches any beast to lie down with it, you shall kill the woman and the beast. They shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> If there is a man who takes his sister, his father’s daughter or his mother’s daughter, and he sees her nakedness and she sees his nakedness, it is a reproach, and they shall be cut off in the sight of the children of their people. He has uncovered his sister’s nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> If there is a man who lies with a woman having her sickness, and he uncovers her nakedness, he has laid bare her flow, and she has uncovered the flow of her blood; and both of them shall be cut off from among their people.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> And you shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother’s sister nor of your father’s sister, for he has made naked his flesh; they shall bear their iniquity.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> If there is a man who lies with his aunt, he has uncovered his uncle’s nakedness. They shall bear their sin; they shall die childless.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> If there is a man who takes his brother’s wife, it is impurity. He has uncovered his brother’s nakedness; they shall be childless.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> You shall therefore keep all My statutes and all My ordinances, and do them, so that the land into which I am bringing you to dwell in does not vomit you out.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> And you shall not walk in the customs of the nation, which I am about to send away before you. Because they did all these things, so I abhorred them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> But I have said to you, You shall inherit their land, and I will give it to you to possess it, a land flowing with milk and honey. I am Jehovah your God, who has separated you from the peoples.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> You shall therefore make a distinction between the clean beast and the unclean, and between the unclean bird and the clean, and you shall not make your souls abominable by any beast or by any bird or by anything that creeps on the ground, which I have separated for you as unclean.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> And you shall be holy to Me, because I Jehovah am holy, and I have set you apart from the peoples to be Mine.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> If there is a man or a woman who is a medium or a spiritist, they shall surely be put to death. They shall stone them with stones; their blood shall be upon them.<br><br>
