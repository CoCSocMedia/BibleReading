  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And you shall make the altar of acacia wood, a length of five cubits and a width of five cubits; the altar shall be square; and three cubits, its height.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And you shall make its horns upon its four corners; its horns shall be of <i>one piece with</i> it, and you shall overlay it with bronze.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And you shall make its pots to remove its ashes, and its shovels and its basins and its forks and its firepans; all its utensils you shall make of bronze.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And you shall make a grating, a network of bronze for it; and on the net you shall make four bronze rings at its four ends.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And you shall put it below, under the ledge of the altar so that the net may reach halfway up the altar.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And you shall make poles for the altar, poles of acacia wood, and overlay them with bronze.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And its poles shall be put into the rings, and the poles shall be on the two sides of the altar when it is carried.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> You shall make it hollow with boards; as it was shown to you in the mountain, so shall they make <i>it.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> And you shall make the court of the tabernacle: On the south side southward there shall be hangings for the court of fine twined linen, a length of one hundred cubits for one side;<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And its twenty pillars and their twenty sockets shall be of bronze; the hooks of the pillars and their connecting rods shall be of silver.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And likewise on the north side, in length there shall be hangings a length of one hundred <i>cubits,</i> and its twenty pillars and their twenty sockets of bronze; the hooks of the pillars and their connecting rods shall be of silver.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And for the width of the court on the west side there shall be hangings of fifty cubits, <i>with</i> their ten pillars and their ten sockets.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> And the width of the court on the east side eastward shall be fifty cubits.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> And there shall be fifteen cubits of hangings for the <i>one</i> side <i>of the gate, with</i> their three pillars and their three sockets.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And there shall be fifteen <i>cubits</i> of hangings for the other side, <i>with</i> their three pillars and their three sockets.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And for the gate of the court there shall be a screen of twenty cubits, of blue and purple and scarlet <i>strands</i> and fine twined linen, the work of an embroiderer; <i>with</i> their four pillars and their four sockets.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> All the pillars around the court shall be connected with silver, <i>with</i> their hooks of silver and their sockets of bronze.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> The length of the court shall be one hundred cubits; and the width, fifty at each end; and the height, five cubits; of fine twined linen, and their sockets of bronze.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> All the utensils of the tabernacle <i>used</i> in all its service and all its pegs and all the pegs of the court shall be of bronze.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> And you shall command the children of Israel to bring to you pure oil of beaten olives for the light, to make the lamps burn continually.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> In the Tent of Meeting, outside the veil which is before the Testimony, Aaron and his sons shall maintain it in order from evening to morning before Jehovah; it shall be a perpetual statute <i>to be observed</i> throughout their generations by the children of Israel.<br><br>
