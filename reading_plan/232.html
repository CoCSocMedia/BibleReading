  <h4 id="zechariah-7"><a onclick="open_chapter('top', '38-zechariah.html')">Zechariah 7</a></h4>
  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And in the fourth year of Darius the king the word of Jehovah came to Zechariah on the fourth <i>day</i> of the ninth month, <i>the month</i> Chislev.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Now <i>the people of</i> Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regemmelech and their men to entreat the favor of Jehovah<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> By speaking to the priests who belong to the house of Jehovah of hosts and to the prophets, saying, Shall I weep in the fifth month and separate myself, as I have done these many years?<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Then the word of Jehovah of hosts came to me, saying,<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> Speak to all the people of the land and to the priests, saying, When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh <i>months,</i> even for these seventy years, was it at all for Me that you fasted?<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And when you eat and when you drink, are you not the ones eating and are you not the ones drinking?<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Are not <i>these</i> the words which Jehovah proclaimed by the former prophets when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous and <i>had</i> cities round about her, when the Negev and the lowlands were inhabited?<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And the word of Jehovah came to Zechariah, saying,<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> Thus speaks Jehovah of hosts, saying, Judge with judgment of truth, and show lovingkindness and compassion each to his brother;<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And do not oppress the widow and the orphan, the stranger and the poor; and let none of you think evil in your hearts about his brother.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> But they refused to listen, and they turned a stubborn shoulder and closed their ears from hearing;<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And they set their hearts like adamant so as not to hear the instruction and the words which Jehovah of hosts sent by His Spirit through the former prophets; therefore great wrath came from Jehovah of hosts.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> And as He called and they would not hear, so they called and I would not hear, says Jehovah of hosts;<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> But with a storm I scattered them away upon all the nations, whom they did not know. Thus the land is desolate behind them, so that no one passes through <i>it</i> and no one returns <i>to it;</i> for they have made the desirable land desolate.<br><br>
