  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Ask rain of Jehovah / At the time of spring rain, / <i>Of</i> Jehovah who makes the lightning, / And He will give them showers of rain, / To everyone herbage in the field.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> For the teraphim have spoken vanity, / And the diviners have seen a lie / And have spoken false dreams; / They comforted in vain. / Therefore <i>the people</i> have wandered like sheep; / They are afflicted because there is no shepherd.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> My anger is kindled against the shepherds, / And I will punish the male goats; / For Jehovah of hosts has visited His flock, the house of Judah, / And will make them like His horse of majesty in battle.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> From him will come forth the cornerstone, from him the peg, / From him the battle bow, / From him every ruler together.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And they will be as mighty men trampling <i>their enemies</i> / In the mire of the streets in the battle; / And they will fight, for Jehovah is with them; / And the riders of horses will be put to shame.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And I will strengthen the house of Judah, / And I will save the house of Joseph; / And I will bring them back, for I have had compassion on them; / And they will be as though I had not rejected them; / For I am Jehovah their God, and I will answer them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And <i>they of</i> Ephraim will be like a mighty man, / And their hearts will rejoice as if with wine; / Indeed, their children will see <i>it</i> and rejoice; / Their heart will exult in Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> I will whistle for them and gather them, for I have redeemed them; / And they will multiply as they have multiplied.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> And I will sow them among the peoples; and in distant lands they will remember Me; / And they will live with their children and return.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> I will also bring them back from the land of Egypt / And gather them out of Assyria; / And to the land of Gilead and Lebanon I will bring them; / And there will not be <i>enough room</i> found for them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And He will pass through the sea <i>of</i> distress / And strike the waves in the sea, / And all the depths of the Nile will dry up; / And the pride of Assyria will be brought down, / And the scepter of Egypt will depart.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And I will strengthen them in Jehovah, / And they will walk about in His name, / Declares Jehovah.<br><br>
