  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then I lifted up my eyes again and I saw, and there was a flying scroll.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And he said to me, What do you see? And I said, I see a flying scroll, its length twenty cubits and its breadth ten cubits.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> Then he said to me, This is the curse that goes forth over the face of all the land; for everyone who steals will be purged according to what is on one side, and everyone who swears will be purged according to what is on the other side.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> I will cause it to go forth, declares Jehovah of hosts; and it will enter the house of him who steals and the house of him who swears falsely by My name; and it will lodge overnight within his house and consume it, both with its timbers and its stones.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> Then the angel who spoke with me went forth and said to me, Lift up now your eyes and see what this is that goes forth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And I said, What is it? And he said, This is the ephah vessel that goes forth; and he said, This is their appearance in all the land;<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> (Then a lead cover was lifted up) and this is a woman sitting within the ephah vessel.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> Then he said, This is Wickedness. And he threw her down into the midst of the ephah vessel and threw the lead weight over its opening.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> Then I lifted up my eyes and I looked, and there were two women going forth, and the wind was in their wings; and they had wings like the wings of a stork. And they lifted up the ephah vessel between the earth and the heavens.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And I said to the angel who spoke with me, Where are they taking the ephah vessel?<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And he said to me, To build a house for her in the land of Shinar; and when it is prepared, she will be set there in her own place.<br><br>
