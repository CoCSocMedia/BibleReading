  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then I lifted up my eyes and I looked, and there was a man, and in His hand was a measuring line.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And I said, Where are You going? And He said to me, To measure Jerusalem; to see how great its breadth is and how great its length is.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> Then at that point the angel who spoke with me went forth and another angel came forth to meet him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And he said to him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem will lie as an open region due to the multitude of men and cattle within it,<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> For I will be her wall of fire round about, declares Jehovah, and I will be the glory within her.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> Ho! Ho! Flee from the land of the north, declares Jehovah, for I have spread you out like the four winds of the heavens, declares Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Ho, Zion! Escape, you who dwell with the daughter of Babylon.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> For thus says Jehovah of hosts, After the glory He has sent Me against the nations who plunder you; for he who touches you touches the pupil of His eye.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> For I am now waving My hand over them, and they will be plunder for those who served them; and you will know that Jehovah of hosts has sent Me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> Give a ringing shout and rejoice, O daughter of Zion, for now I am coming, and I will dwell in your midst, declares Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And many nations will join themselves to Jehovah in that day and will become My people; and I will dwell in your midst, and you will know that Jehovah of hosts has sent Me to you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And Jehovah will inherit Judah as His portion upon the holy land, and He will again choose Jerusalem.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> Hush, all flesh, before Jehovah! For He is roused up from His holy habitation.<br><br>
