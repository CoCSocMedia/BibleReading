  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> This shall be the law of the leper on the day of his cleansing: He shall be brought to the priest,<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And the priest shall go forth outside the camp. Then the priest shall look, and if the infection of leprosy has been healed in the leper,<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Then the priest shall command that two living clean birds and cedar wood and scarlet <i>strands</i> and hyssop be taken for the one who is to be cleansed.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And the priest shall command that one of the birds be slaughtered in an earthen vessel over running water.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> As for the living bird, he shall take it and the cedar wood and the scarlet <i>strands</i> and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was slaughtered over the running water.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And he shall sprinkle <i>it</i> on the one who is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times and shall pronounce him clean. Then he shall let the living bird go into the open field.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And the one who is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes and shave off all his hair and bathe in water, and he shall be clean. And after that he may come into the camp, but he shall dwell outside his tent seven days.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> And on the seventh day he shall shave off all his hair; he shall shave his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair. Then he shall wash his clothes and bathe his flesh in water, and he shall be clean.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And on the eighth day he shall take two male lambs without blemish and one ewe lamb a year old without blemish and three-tenths <i>of an ephah</i> of fine flour for a meal offering mingled with oil and one log of oil.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And the priest who makes him clean shall set the man to be cleansed and those things before Jehovah at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And the priest shall take one of the male lambs and present it as a trespass offering and the log of oil, and wave them as a wave offering before Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> Then he shall slaughter the male lamb in the place where they slaughter the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the place of the sanctuary; for the trespass offering, like the sin offering, is the priest’s; it is most holy.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> And the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering, and the priest shall put <i>it</i> on the lobe of the right ear of the one who is to be cleansed and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And the priest shall take some of the log of oil and pour <i>it</i> into the palm of the priest’s left <i>hand,</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in the palm of his left <i>hand</i> and sprinkle some of the oil with his finger seven times before Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> And from the rest of the oil that is in the palm of his <i>hand</i> the priest shall put <i>some</i> on the lobe of the right ear of the one who is to be cleansed and <i>some</i> on the thumb of his right hand and <i>some</i> on the big toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass offering.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> And the rest of the oil that is in the palm of the priest’s <i>hand</i> he shall put on the head of the one who is to be cleansed. Then the priest shall make expiation for him before Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> And the priest shall offer the sin offering and make expiation for the one who is to be cleansed because of his uncleanness, and afterward he shall slaughter the burnt offering.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> And the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the meal offering on the altar. Thus the priest shall make expiation for him, and he shall be clean.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> But if he is poor and cannot afford <i>so much,</i> then he shall take one male lamb for a trespass offering to be waved to make expiation for him, and one-tenth <i>of an ephah</i> of fine flour mingled with oil for a meal offering, and a log of oil,<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> And two turtledoves or two young pigeons, such as he can afford; and the one shall be a sin offering and the other a burnt offering.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> And on the eighth day he shall bring them for his cleansing to the priest, to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, before Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> Then the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them as a wave offering before Jehovah;<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> And he shall slaughter the lamb of the trespass offering. Then the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering and put <i>it</i> on the lobe of the right ear of the one who is to be cleansed and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> And the priest shall pour some of the oil into the palm of the priest’s left <i>hand,</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> And the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is in the palm of his left <i>hand</i> seven times before Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> And the priest shall put some of the oil that is in the palm of his <i>hand</i> on the lobe of the right ear of the one who is to be cleansed and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot, upon the place of the blood of the trespass offering.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> And the rest of the oil that is in the palm of the priest’s <i>hand</i> he shall put on the head of the one who is to be cleansed, to make expiation for him before Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> And he shall offer one of the turtledoves or young pigeons, such as he can afford,<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> Even such as he can afford, one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering, with the meal offering; and the priest shall make expiation for the one who is to be cleansed before Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> This is the law for the one in whom there is the infection of leprosy, who cannot afford <i>what is prescribed</i> for his cleansing.<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> Then Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,<br><br>
     <sup><b>34</b></sup> When you come into the land of Canaan, which I give you for a possession, and I put the infection of leprosy in a house in the land of your possession,<br><br>
     <sup><b>35</b></sup> Then he to whom the house belongs shall come and tell the priest, saying, It seems to me that <i>there is something</i> like an infection in the house.<br><br>
     <sup><b>36</b></sup> And the priest shall command that they empty the house before the priest goes in to look at the infection, so that everything which is in the house does not become unclean; and afterward the priest shall go in to look at the house.<br><br>
     <sup><b>37</b></sup> And he shall look at the infection; and if the infection is on the walls of the house with greenish or reddish depressions, and their appearance is deeper than <i>the surface of</i> the wall,<br><br>
     <sup><b>38</b></sup> Then the priest shall come out of the house to the entrance of the house and shut up the house seven days.<br><br>
     <sup><b>39</b></sup> And the priest shall return on the seventh day and inspect <i>it.</i> And if the infection has spread in the walls of the house,<br><br>
     <sup><b>40</b></sup> Then the priest shall command that they take out the stones on which the infection is and throw them away outside the city into an unclean place.<br><br>
     <sup><b>41</b></sup> And he shall have the house scraped inside all around, and they shall dump the plaster that they scrape off outside the city into an unclean place.<br><br>
     <sup><b>42</b></sup> And they shall take other stones and put them in the place of those stones, and he shall take other plaster and replaster the house.<br><br>
     <sup><b>43</b></sup> And if the infection returns and breaks out in the house after he has taken out the stones and after he has scraped the house and after it has been replastered,<br><br>
     <sup><b>44</b></sup> Then the priest shall come in and look; and if the infection has spread in the house, it is a malignant leprosy in the house; it is unclean.<br><br>
     <sup><b>45</b></sup> And he shall break down the house, its stones and its timber and all the plaster of the house, and he shall bring <i>them</i> outside the city into an unclean place.<br><br>
     <sup><b>46</b></sup> Moreover, whoever goes into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the evening.<br><br>
     <sup><b>47</b></sup> And whoever lies down in the house shall wash his clothes, and whoever eats in the house shall wash his clothes.<br><br>
     <sup><b>48</b></sup> But if on the other hand the priest comes in and looks, and if the infection has not spread in the house after the house has been replastered, then the priest shall pronounce the house clean because the infection has been healed.<br><br>
     <sup><b>49</b></sup> And he shall take two birds and cedar wood and scarlet <i>strands</i> and hyssop to purify the house,<br><br>
     <sup><b>50</b></sup> And he shall slaughter one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water.<br><br>
     <sup><b>51</b></sup> And he shall take the cedar wood and the hyssop and the scarlet <i>strands</i> and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the bird that was slaughtered and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times.<br><br>
     <sup><b>52</b></sup> And he shall purify the house with the blood of the bird and with the running water and with the living bird and with the cedar wood and with the hyssop and with the scarlet <i>strands.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>53</b></sup> And he shall let the living bird go, outside the city into the open field. So he shall make expiation for the house, and it shall be clean.<br><br>
     <sup><b>54</b></sup> This is the law for any kind of infection of leprosy and for a scale<br><br>
     <sup><b>55</b></sup> And for the leprosy of a garment and for a house<br><br>
     <sup><b>56</b></sup> And for a swelling and for an eruption and for a bright spot,<br><br>
     <sup><b>57</b></sup> To teach when it is unclean and when it is clean. This is the law of leprosy.<br><br>
