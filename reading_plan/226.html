  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And Moses gathered all the assembly of the children of Israel and said to them, These are the words which Jehovah has commanded you to do.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day you shall have a Sabbath of complete rest, holy to Jehovah; whoever does any work on it shall be put to death.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> You shall kindle no fire in any of your dwellings on the Sabbath day.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And Moses spoke to all the assembly of the children of Israel, saying, This is what Jehovah has commanded, saying,<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> Take from among yourselves a heave offering to Jehovah; whoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it, the heave offering of Jehovah: gold and silver and bronze,<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And blue and purple and scarlet <i>strands,</i> and fine linen, and goats’ <i>hair,</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And rams’ skins dyed red, and porpoise skins, and acacia wood,<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And oil for the light, and spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense,<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> And onyx stones and stones to be set for the ephod and for the breastplate.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And let every man who is wise in heart among you come and make all that Jehovah has commanded:<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> The tabernacle, its tent, and its covering; its clasps and its boards; its bars, its pillars, and its sockets;<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> The Ark and its poles, the expiation cover, and the veil of the screen;<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> The table and its poles and all its utensils, and the bread of the Presence;<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> And the lampstand for the light and its utensils and its lamps, and the oil for the light;<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And the altar of incense and its poles; and the anointing oil and the fragrant incense; and the screen for the entrance, at the entrance of the tabernacle;<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> The altar of burnt offering, with its grating of bronze, its poles, and all its utensils; the laver and its base;<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> The hangings of the court, its pillars, and its sockets, and the screen for the gate of the court;<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> The pegs of the tabernacle and the pegs of the court, and their cords;<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> The finely worked garments for ministering in the sanctuary, the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments of his sons <i>for them</i> to serve as priests.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> And all the assembly of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And they came, everyone whose heart lifted him up and everyone whose spirit made him willing, <i>and</i> brought the heave offering of Jehovah for the work of the Tent of Meeting and for all its service and for the holy garments.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> And they came, men together with women, as many as were of a willing heart, <i>and</i> brought nose rings and earrings and signet rings and pendants, all <i>kinds of</i> articles of gold; even every man who waved a wave offering of gold to Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> And every man with whom was found blue and purple and scarlet <i>strands</i> and fine linen and goats’ <i>hair</i> and rams’ skins dyed red and porpoise skins brought <i>them.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> Everyone who offered a heave offering of silver and bronze brought the heave offering of Jehovah, and every man with whom was found acacia wood for any work of the service brought <i>it.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> And all the women who were wise in heart spun with their hands and brought what they had spun, the blue and the purple <i>and</i> the scarlet <i>strands</i> and the fine linen.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> And all the women whose heart lifted them up in wisdom spun the goats’ <i>hair.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> And the leaders brought the onyx stones and the stones for setting for the ephod and for the breastplate,<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> And the spices and the oil for the light and for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> The children of Israel brought a freewill offering to Jehovah, every man and woman whose heart made them willing to bring for all the work, which Jehovah had commanded through Moses to be done.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> And Moses said to the children of Israel, See, Jehovah has called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> And He has filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom, with understanding, and with knowledge, and with all <i>kinds of</i> workmanship;<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> Even to fashion skillful designs, to work in gold and in silver and in bronze,<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> And in the cutting of stones for setting and in the carving of wood, to work in all <i>kinds of</i> skillful workmanship.<br><br>
     <sup><b>34</b></sup> And He has put in his heart to teach, both he and Oholiab the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.<br><br>
     <sup><b>35</b></sup> He has filled them with wisdom of heart, to work all <i>kinds of</i> workmanship, of an engraver and of a skillful workman and of an embroiderer in blue and in purple <i>and</i> in scarlet <i>strands</i> and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of those who do all <i>kinds of</i> workmanship and of those who fashion skillful designs.<br><br>
