How to add readings as of 7/2/2021 [might change later]:

day 182 = July 1

To add a reading, create a new html file called n.html where n refers to the
nth day of reading. Ex: 183.html would be the reading for July 2. Copy and paste
any already existing reading file. Then go into the Bible folder and find the
corresponding reading. Copy and paste the chapter into the "bible-text" section
of the html file.
