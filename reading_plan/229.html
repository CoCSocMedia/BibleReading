  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then the angel who spoke with me returned and roused me as a man is roused from his sleep.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And he said to me, What do you see? And I said, I see that there is a lampstand all of gold, with its bowl on top of it and its seven lamps upon it, with seven pipes for each of the lamps on top of it;<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And <i>there are</i> two olive trees beside it, one to the right of the bowl and one to the left.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And I answered and spoke to the angel who spoke with me, saying, What are these, sir?<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And the angel who spoke with me answered and said to me, Do you not know what these are? And I said, No, sir.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And he answered and spoke to me, saying, This is the word of Jehovah to Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit, says Jehovah of hosts.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Who are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel <i>you will become</i> a plain, and he will bring forth the topstone with shouts of Grace, grace to it!<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> Moreover the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands will finish <i>it;</i> and you will know that Jehovah of hosts has sent Me to you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> For who has despised the day of small things? For these seven rejoice when they see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel; they are the eyes of Jehovah running to and fro on the whole earth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> Then I answered and said to him, What are these two olive trees on the right of the lampstand and on its left?<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And I answered a second time and said to him, What are the two olive branches that are by the side of the two golden spouts, which empty the gold from themselves?<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> And he spoke to me, saying, Do you not know what these are? And I said, No, sir.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> And he said, These are the two sons of oil, who stand by the Lord of the whole earth.<br><br>
