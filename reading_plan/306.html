  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And the entire multitude of them rose up and led Him before Pilate.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And they began to accuse Him, saying, We found this man perverting our nation and forbidding people to pay taxes to Caesar, and saying that He Himself is Christ, a King.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And Pilate asked Him, saying, Are You the King of the Jews? And answering him, He said, It is as you say.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, I find no fault in this man.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> But they were vehement, saying, He stirs up the people, teaching throughout the whole of Judea, beginning from Galilee even to this place.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And when Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilean.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And when he realized that He was of Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent Him up to Herod, who also himself was in Jerusalem in those days.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And when Herod saw Jesus, he rejoiced greatly, for he had wanted to see Him for a considerable time, because he had heard about Him, and was hoping to see some sign done by Him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> And he questioned Him with many words, but He answered him nothing.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And the chief priests and the scribes stood by, vehemently accusing Him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And Herod with his soldiers, having despised Him and mocked Him, threw around Him splendid clothing and sent Him back to Pilate.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And both Herod and Pilate became friends with one another on that very day, for they had previously been at enmity toward each other.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> And Pilate, calling together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> Said to them, You have brought this man to me as one who turns the people away, and behold, I have examined Him before you and found no fault in this man regarding the accusations you bring against Him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> No, neither has Herod, for he sent Him back to us, and behold, nothing worthy of death has been done by Him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> I will therefore discipline Him and release Him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> Now he was obliged to release to them one prisoner at the feast.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> But they cried out all together, saying, Take this man away and release to us Barabbas.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> He was one who, for a certain insurrection that occurred in the city and for murder, had been thrown into the prison.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> But Pilate, wanting to release Jesus, addressed them again;<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> But they continued to shout, saying, Crucify, crucify Him!<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> But he said to them a third time, Why, what evil has this man done? I have found no cause of death in Him; I will therefore discipline Him and release Him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> But they pressed him with loud voices, asking that He be crucified, and their voices prevailed.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> And Pilate gave sentence that their request be carried out,<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> And he released him who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, whom they asked for; but Jesus he delivered up to their will.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> And as they led Him away, they laid hold of Simon, a certain Cyrenian, coming from the country, and they placed the cross upon him to carry it behind Jesus.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> And a great multitude of the people and of women who were mourning and lamenting Him followed Him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> But Jesus turned to them and said, Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep over Me, but weep over yourselves and over your children.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> For behold, the days are coming in which they will say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs which have not borne, and the breasts which have not nourished.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> Then they will begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us! and to the hills, Cover us!<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> For if they do these things with the tree full of sap, what will happen with the one that is dry?<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> And two others also, who were criminals, were led with Him to be executed.<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> And when they came to the place called The Skull, there they crucified Him and the criminals, one on the right and one on the left.<br><br>
     <sup><b>34</b></sup> And Jesus said, Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing. And dividing His garments, they cast lots.<br><br>
     <sup><b>35</b></sup> And the people stood by, looking on. And the rulers also sneered, saying, He saved others; let Him save Himself if this is the Christ of God, the Chosen One!<br><br>
     <sup><b>36</b></sup> And the soldiers also mocked Him, coming to Him and offering Him vinegar,<br><br>
     <sup><b>37</b></sup> And saying, If You are the King of the Jews, save Yourself!<br><br>
     <sup><b>38</b></sup> And there was also an inscription over Him: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.<br><br>
     <sup><b>39</b></sup> And one of the criminals who were hanged there blasphemed Him, saying, Are You not the Christ? Save Yourself and us!<br><br>
     <sup><b>40</b></sup> But the other, answering, rebuked him and said, Do you not even fear God, since you are in the same judgment?<br><br>
     <sup><b>41</b></sup> And we justly, for we are receiving what we deserve for what we did, but this man has done nothing amiss.<br><br>
     <sup><b>42</b></sup> And he said, Jesus, remember me when You come into Your kingdom.<br><br>
     <sup><b>43</b></sup> And He said to him, Truly I say to you, Today you shall be with Me in Paradise.<br><br>
     <sup><b>44</b></sup> And it was now about the sixth hour, and darkness fell over the whole land until the ninth hour,<br><br>
     <sup><b>45</b></sup> The sun’s light failing; and the veil of the temple was split down the middle.<br><br>
     <sup><b>46</b></sup> And crying with a loud voice, Jesus said, Father, into Your hands I commit My spirit. And saying this, He expired.<br><br>
     <sup><b>47</b></sup> Now when the centurion saw what had happened, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this man was righteous.<br><br>
     <sup><b>48</b></sup> And all the crowds who came together at this spectacle, when they beheld the things that happened, returned, beating their breasts.<br><br>
     <sup><b>49</b></sup> And all those who knew Him, and the women who accompanied Him from Galilee, stood at a distance, observing these things.<br><br>
     <sup><b>50</b></sup> And behold, there was a man named Joseph, who was a member of the Council, and a good and righteous man<br><br>
     <sup><b>51</b></sup> (This man had not consented to their counsel and action), from Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who was expecting the kingdom of God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>52</b></sup> This man came to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.<br><br>
     <sup><b>53</b></sup> And he took it down and wrapped it in a fine linen cloth, and laid Him in a tomb hewn in the rock, where no one had ever lain.<br><br>
     <sup><b>54</b></sup> And it was the day of preparation, and the Sabbath was coming on.<br><br>
     <sup><b>55</b></sup> And the women who had come together with Him out of Galilee followed after and beheld the tomb and how His body was laid.<br><br>
     <sup><b>56</b></sup> And they returned and prepared spices and ointment. And on the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment. <br><br>
