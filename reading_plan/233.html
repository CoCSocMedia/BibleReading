  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> If there is therefore any encouragement in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of spirit, if any tenderheartedness and compassions,<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Make my joy full, that you think the same thing, having the same love, joined in soul, thinking the one thing,<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> Doing nothing by way of selfish ambition nor by way of vainglory, but in lowliness of mind considering one another more excellent than yourselves;<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Not regarding each his own virtues, but each the virtues of others also.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus,<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> Who, existing in the form of God, did not consider being equal with God a treasure to be grasped,<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> But emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men;<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, becoming obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> Therefore also God highly exalted Him and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name,<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> That in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth,<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And every tongue should openly confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> So then, my beloved, even as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only but now much rather in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling;<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> Do all things without murmurings and reasonings<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> That you may be blameless and guileless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation, among whom you shine as luminaries in the world,<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> Holding forth the word of life, so that I may have a boast in the day of Christ that I did not run in vain nor labor in vain.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice, and I rejoice together with you all.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> And in like manner you also rejoice, and you rejoice together with me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly, that I also may be encouraged by knowing the things concerning you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> For I have no one like-souled who will genuinely care for what concerns you;<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> For all seek their own things, not the things of Christ Jesus.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> But you know his approvedness, that as a child with a father he has served with me unto the gospel.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> Him therefore I hope to send immediately, as soon as I see how things go with me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> But I trust in the Lord that I myself also will come shortly.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> But I considered it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, and your apostle and minister to my need,<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> Since he longed after you all and was greatly distressed because you heard that he had become sick;<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> For indeed he had become sick, near to death, but God had mercy on him, and not on him only but also on me that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> I have sent him therefore the more eagerly, so that when you see him again, you may rejoice and I may be less sorrowful.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy, and hold such in honor,<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> Because for the work of Christ he drew near unto death, risking his life, that he might fill up your lack of service toward me. <br><br>
