			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Truly, truly, I say to you, He who does not enter through the door into the sheepfold, but climbs up from somewhere else, he is a thief and a robber;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> But he who enters through the door is the shepherd of the sheep.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> To him the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep hear his voice; and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> When he puts forth all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him because they know his voice.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> But they will by no means follow a stranger, but will flee from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> This parable Jesus spoke to them, but they did not know what those things meant that He spoke to them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> Jesus therefore said to them again, Truly, truly, I say to you that I am the door of the sheep.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> All who came before Me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he shall be saved and shall go in and go out and shall find pasture.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> The thief does not come except to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> I am the good Shepherd; the good Shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> He who is a hireling and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf snatches them and scatters them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> He flees because he is a hireling and it does not matter to him concerning the sheep.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> I am the good Shepherd, and I know My own, and My own know Me,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> Even as the Father knows Me and I know the Father; and I lay down My life for the sheep.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And I have other sheep, which are not of this fold; I must lead them also, and they shall hear My voice, and there shall be one flock, one Shepherd.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> For this reason the Father loves Me, because I lay down My life that I may take it again.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> No one takes it away from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it again. This commandment I received from My Father.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> A division again took place among the Jews because of these words.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And many of them said, He has a demon and is insane. Why do you listen to Him?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> Others said, These are not the words of one who is demon-possessed. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> At that time the Feast of the Dedication occurred in Jerusalem, and it was winter.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And Jesus was walking in the temple in the portico of Solomon.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> The Jews therefore surrounded Him and said to Him, How long will You hold our soul in suspense? If You are the Christ, tell us plainly.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> Jesus answered them, I told you, and you do not believe. The works which I do in My Father’s name, these testify concerning Me;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> But you do not believe, because you are not of My sheep.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> And I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever, and no one shall snatch them out of My hand.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of My Father’s hand.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> I and the Father are one.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> The Jews again took up stones that they might stone Him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> Jesus answered them, I have shown you many good works from the Father; for which of these works are you stoning Me?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> The Jews answered Him, We are not stoning You for a good work, but for blasphemy, and because You, being a man, are making Yourself God.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, “I said, You are gods”?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>35</b></sup> If He said they were gods, to whom the word of God came, and the Scripture cannot be broken,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>36</b></sup> Do you say of Him whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world, You are blaspheming, because I said, I am the Son of God?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>37</b></sup> If I do not do the works of My Father, do not believe Me;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>38</b></sup> But if I do them, even if you do not believe Me, believe the works so that you may come to know and continue to know that the Father is in Me and I am in the Father.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>39</b></sup> Then they sought again to seize Him, yet He went forth out of their hand.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>40</b></sup> And He went away again across the Jordan, to the place where John was baptizing at first, and He remained there.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>41</b></sup> And many came to Him and said, John did no sign, but all the things John said concerning this man were true.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>42</b></sup> And many believed into Him there.<br><br>
