  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> In that day there will be an opened fountain for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for impurity.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And in that day, declares Jehovah of hosts, I will cut off the names of the idols from the land, and they will no longer be remembered; and I will also cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass from the land.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And if anyone still prophesies, his father and mother, who begot him, will say to him, You shall not live, for you have spoken falsely in the name of Jehovah; and his father and mother, who begot him, will pierce him through when he prophesies.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And in that day the prophets will each be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies; and they will not wear a hairy garment in order to deceive.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> But He will say, I am no prophet; I am a tiller of the ground; for a man sold Me in My youth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And <i>someone</i> will say to Him, What are these wounds between Your arms? And He will say, Those with which I was wounded in the house of those who love Me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd, / And against the man <i>who is</i> My Fellow, / Declares Jehovah of hosts. Strike the Shepherd, / That the sheep may be scattered; / And I will turn My hand upon the little ones.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And in all the land, declares Jehovah, / Two parts in it will be cut off <i>and</i> will die, / But the third part will be left in it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> And I will bring the third part through fire / And refine them as silver is refined / And try them as gold is tried. / They will call on My name, / And I will answer them; / I will say, They are My people, / And they will say, Jehovah is my God.<br><br>
