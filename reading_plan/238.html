  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Speak to the children of Israel and say to them, When any man has a discharge from his body, his discharge is unclean.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And this shall be his uncleanness of his discharge: Whether there is a discharge from his body, or the discharge is blocked in his body, it is his uncleanness.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Every bed on which he who has the discharge lies shall be unclean, and everything on which he sits shall be unclean.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And whoever touches his bed shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until the evening.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And whoever sits on anything on which he who has the discharge sat shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until the evening.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And whoever touches the flesh of the one who has the discharge shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until the evening.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And if the one who has the discharge spits on someone who is clean, then he <i>who has been spat on</i> shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until the evening.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> And every saddle on which the one who has the discharge rides shall be unclean.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And whoever touches anything that was under him shall be unclean until the evening, and whoever carries those things shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until the evening.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And whomever the one who has the discharge touches without having rinsed his hands in water, he shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until the evening.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And the earthen vessel that the one who has the discharge touches shall be broken, and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> And when one who has the discharge is cleansed of his discharge, then he shall count seven days for himself for his cleansing; then he shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in running water, and he shall be clean.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> And on the eighth day he shall take for himself two turtledoves or two young pigeons and come before Jehovah at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting and give them to the priest.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And the priest shall offer them, one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make expiation for him before Jehovah for his discharge.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And if any man’s seed of copulation goes out from him, then he shall bathe his entire body in water and be unclean until the evening.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> And any garment and any <i>article made of</i> skin on which the seed of copulation comes shall be washed with water and be unclean until the evening.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> If there is a woman with whom a man lies <i>and there is a discharge of</i> seed of copulation, both of them shall bathe in water and be unclean until the evening.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> And if a woman has a discharge, <i>and</i> her discharge in her body is blood, she shall be in her impurity seven days; and whoever touches her shall be unclean until the evening.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> And everything that she lies on in her impurity shall be unclean; everything also that she sits on shall be unclean.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And whoever touches her bed shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until the evening.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> And whoever touches anything that she sits on shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until the evening.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> And if it is on the bed or on anything on which she sits, when anyone touches it, he shall be unclean until the evening.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> And if any man actually lies with her and her impurity comes on him, he shall be unclean seven days; and every bed on which he lies shall be unclean.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> And if a woman has a discharge of her blood for many days not at the time of her impurity, or if she has a discharge beyond the time of her impurity, during all the days of the discharge of her uncleanness she shall be as if in the days of her impurity; she is unclean.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> Any bed on which she lies during all the days of her discharge shall be to her like the bed of her impurity; and everything on which she sits shall be unclean, as in the uncleanness of her impurity.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> And whoever touches those things shall be unclean, and he shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until the evening.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> But if she is cleansed of her discharge, then she shall count seven days for herself; and afterward she shall be clean.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> And on the eighth day she shall take for herself two turtledoves or two young pigeons and bring them to the priest at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> And the priest shall offer one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering, and the priest shall make expiation for her before Jehovah for the discharge of her uncleanness.<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> Thus you shall separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness, so that they do not die in their uncleanness by their defiling My tabernacle that is in the midst of them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> This is the law for the one who has a discharge and for the one whose seed of copulation goes out from him and becomes unclean by it,<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> And for the one who is sick with her impurity, and for anyone who has a discharge, male or female, and for a man who lies with a woman who is unclean.<br><br>
